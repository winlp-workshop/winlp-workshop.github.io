Anyone who self-identifies as being from an underrepresented background—based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, disability, or otherwise—is encouraged to submit. In 2025, WiNLP will continue placing emphasis on access, disability, and diversity across scientific backgrounds, disciplines, training, and underrepresented languages.\n",
