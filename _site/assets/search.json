The anbik is also called the raʾs (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.\n\nOriginally from Alembic - Wikipedia\n",

Amongst others, it is mentioned in the Mafatih al-Ulum (Key of Sciences) of Khwarizmi and the Kitab al-Asrar (Book of Secrets) of Al-Razi. Some illustrations occur in the Latin translations of works which are attributed to Geber.[2]\n\nOriginally from Alembic - Wikipedia\n",

        "content": "A pot still is a type of still used in distilling spirits such as whisky or brandy. Heat is applied directly to the pot containing the wash (for whisky) or wine (for brandy). This is called a batch distillation (as opposed to a continuous distillation).\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, alcohol boils at 78 °C (172 °F), while water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). During distillation, the vapour contains more alcohol than the liquid. When the vapours are condensed, the resulting liquid contains a higher concentration of alcohol. In the pot still, the alcohol and water vapour combine with esters and flow from the still through the condensing coil. There they condense into the first distillation liquid, the so-called “low wines”. The low wines have a strength of about 25–35% alcohol by volume, and flow into a second still. It is then distilled a second time to produce the colourless spirit, collected at about 70% alcohol by volume. Colour is added through maturation in an oak aging barrel, and develops over time.\n\nThe modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.\n",

    "title": "WiNLP 2025 Workshop - Call for Papers",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "Workshop Description\n\nThe Widening NLP (WiNLP) workshop aims to foster an inclusive environment that highlights the contributions of researchers from underrepresented groups in NLP. Anyone who self-identifies as being from an underrepresented background—based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, disability, or otherwise—is encouraged to submit. In 2025, WiNLP will continue placing emphasis on access, disability, and diversity across scientific backgrounds, disciplines, training, and underrepresented languages.\n\nOur annual Widening Natural Language Processing Workshop (WiNLP) will be held in conjunction with EMNLP 2025 in Suzhou, China. Since EMNLP is anticipating a hybrid format for their conference, we also anticipate our workshop will be hybrid, with both online and in-person attendees. The one-day workshop will occur during EMNLP’s workshop period with an exact date to be announced soon.\n\nThe full-day event includes invited talks, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice. It also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs. Most importantly, the workshop will provide an inclusive and accepting space, and work to lower structural barriers to joining and collaborating with the NLP community at large.\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nWhile everyone is encouraged to attend, the opportunity to present a talk or poster is intended for members of underrepresented groups at all career levels: students, post-docs, professors, and other researchers.\n\nCategories of Submissions\n\n\n  Thesis Proposals: Designed for graduate students (Master’s or PhD) to present their research plans and receive constructive feedback.\n  Research Papers: Encompasses both work-in-progress with preliminary results and completed research.\n\n\nSubmission Length Options\n\nBoth categories can be submitted as:\n\n\n  Short Papers: Up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendices. An additional content page is permitted upon acceptance (maximum 5 pages).\n  Extended Abstracts: Up to 2 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendices. An additional content page is permitted upon acceptance (maximum 3 pages).\n\n\nArchival vs. Non-Archival Papers\n\nAuthors of short papers may choose whether their submission is archival or non-archival:\n\n\n  Archival Papers: Will be published in the EMNLP 2025 WiNLP Proceedings.\n  Non-Archival Papers: Can be submitted to other venues in the future, except for another WiNLP workshop.\n\n\n\n  Note: Paper submissions must be fully self-contained. Supplementary materials, as provided in the appendix, are completely optional, and reviewers are not asked to review them. No separate supplementary files will be accepted.\n\n\n\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\n\n  Formatting: Submissions must adhere to the official ACL style templates (available via Overleaf and downloadable LaTeX/Word formats). Papers must be in a two-column ACL format.\n  File Type: PDF only.\n  Submission Link: OpenReview Submission Portal\n  Anonymization: All submissions must be anonymized for review to ensure fairness.\n\n\nTopics\n\nSubmissions can cover a wide range of topics in computational linguistics and NLP, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  Safety and alignment in large language models (LLMs)\n  AI/LLM agents\n  Human-AI interaction and cooperation\n  Retrieval-augmented language models\n  Mathematical, symbolic, and logical reasoning in NLP\n  Computational social science and NLP for social good\n  Code models\n  Interpretability, model editing, transparency, and explainability\n  LLM efficiency\n  Generalizability and transfer learning\n  Dialogue and interactive systems\n  Discourse, pragmatics, and reasoning\n  Low-resource methods for NLP\n  Ethics, bias, and fairness\n  Natural language generation\n  Information extraction and retrieval\n  Linguistic theories, cognitive modeling, and psycholinguistics\n  Machine translation\n  Multilinguality and language diversity\n  Multimodality and language grounding (e.g., vision, robotics)\n  Neurosymbolic approaches to NLP\n  Phonology, morphology, and word segmentation\n  Question answering\n  Resources and evaluation\n  Semantics (lexical, sentence-level, textual inference)\n  Sentiment analysis, stylistic analysis, and argument mining\n  Speech processing and spoken language understanding\n  Summarization\n  Hierarchical structure prediction, syntax, and parsing\n  NLP applications\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Submission Policy\n\nFor archival papers, WiNLP enforces a strict no multiple submission policy. Such papers submitted to WiNLP must not be under review at another journal, conference, or workshop during the WiNLP submission and review period. This prohibition includes submissions to ACL Rolling Review (ARR) 2025 May and EMNLP 2025. WiNLP submissions should not overlap significantly in content or results with papers that are already published or will be published elsewhere.\n\n\n\nImportant Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 PM UTC-12:00 (“Anywhere on Earth”)\n\n\n  \n    \n      Event\n      Date\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Pre-submission mentoring deadline\n      June 20, 2025\n    \n    \n      Pre-submission feedback returned\n      July 18, 2025\n    \n    \n      Paper submission deadline\n      August 1, 2025\n    \n    \n      Acceptance notifications\n      September 15, 2025\n    \n    \n      Camera-ready deadline\n      October 1, 2025\n    \n    \n      Travel grant applications due\n      September 26, 2025\n    \n    \n      Travel grant notifications\n      October 6, 2025\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nPre-Submission Mentorship Program\n\nWiNLP offers an optional pre-submission mentorship program to help authors improve the quality of their writing and presentation before final submission. The program focuses on enhancing clarity and structure, not critiquing the research content.\n\nHow It Works\n\n\n  Submission: Authors must submit a draft via the designated Google Form by June 20, 2025. Drafts must follow the same formatting and length guidelines as final submissions.\n  Mentor Assignment: Organizers will check compliance before assigning a mentor. Mentors will not review the final submission.\n  Feedback: Provided by July 18, 2025, offering suggestions to improve writing and presentation. Authors are encouraged to incorporate this feedback before the final deadline.\n  Non-Anonymous: The mentorship process is not anonymized.\n  Final Submission: Authors who participate should submit their final paper as a new submission via OpenReview by August 1st, 2025. Participation is not required for submission eligibility.\n\n\n\n\nTravel Support\n\nWiNLP offers a limited number of travel grants to support one author per accepted submission. Grants may cover registration, travel, lodging, or visa costs. Funded authors may choose to attend virtually if preferred.\n\nKey Dates\n\n\n  \n    \n      Event\n      Date\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Travel grant application deadline\n      September 26, 2025\n    \n    \n      Notification\n      October 6, 2025\n    \n  \n\n\nEligibility\n\n\n  One author per accepted submission is eligible.\n  The funded author must be identified in the travel grant application form.\n\n\nAdditional funding for virtual attendance by other authors may be considered if surplus funds are available, but in-person attendance for additional authors is not guaranteed.\n\nTravel expenses are handled via reimbursement (primarily through USD check or PayPal). Authors unable to front travel costs should contact the organizers early to discuss alternatives.\n\n\n  Note: Authors are encouraged to explore local funding options (e.g., institutional support) to maximize the reach of WiNLP’s limited funds. We recommend student authors also look into the EMNLP call for student volunteers or call for D&amp;I subsidies for further funding opportunities.\n\n\n\n\nContact Information\n\n\n  Website: WiNLP 2025 Call for Submissions\n  Twitter: @winlpworkshop\n  Facebook: Widening NLP\n  LinkedIn: Widening NLP\n  Email: winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com\n\n",

Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nCustomising\n\nWhen using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.\n\nTo add your own styles copy the styles.scss into your own project with the same file path (assets/styles.scss). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the @import \"alembic\"; line.\n\nIf you’re looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the _settings.scss file in your own styles.scss, make sure to state them before the @import \"alembic\"; line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from Sassline - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.\n",
