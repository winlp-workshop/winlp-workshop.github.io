    "title": "WiNLP 2025 Workshop - Call for Papers",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "\n\nWorkshop Description\n\nThe Widening NLP (WiNLP) workshop aims to foster an inclusive environment that highlights the contributions of researchers from underrepresented groups in NLP. Anyone who self-identifies as being from an underrepresented background—based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, disability, or otherwise—is encouraged to submit. In 2025, WiNLP will continue placing emphasis on access, disability, and diversity across scientific backgrounds, disciplines, training, and underrepresented languages.\n\nOur annual Widening Natural Language Processing Workshop (WiNLP) will be held in conjunction with EMNLP 2025 in Suzhou, China. Since EMNLP is anticipating a hybrid format for their conference, we also anticipate our workshop will be hybrid, with both online and in-person attendees. The one-day workshop will occur during EMNLP’s workshop period with an exact date to be announced soon.\n\nThe full-day event includes invited talks, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice.  It also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs. Most importantly,  the workshop will provide an inclusive and accepting space, and work to lower structural barriers to joining and collaborating with the NLP community at large.\n\n\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nWhile everyone is encouraged to attend, the opportunity to present a talk or poster is intended for members of underrepresented groups at all career levels: students, post-docs, professors, and other researchers.\n\nSubmissions are invited in two categories:\n\n\n  Thesis Proposals: Designed for graduate students (Master’s or PhD) to present their research plans and receive constructive feedback.\n  Research Papers: Encompasses both work-in-progress with preliminary results and completed research.\n\n\nSubmissions in both categories can be either:\n\n\n  Short Papers: Up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendices. An additional content page is permitted upon acceptance (maximum 5 pages).\n  Extended Abstracts: Up to 2 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendices. An additional content page is permitted upon acceptance (maximum 3 pages).\n\n\nAuthors of short papers may choose whether their submission is archival or non-archival. Archival Papers will be published in the EMNLP 2025 WiNLP Proceedings. Non-Archival Papers can be submitted to other venues in the future, except for another WiNLP workshop. Note, however, paper submissions must be fully self-contained, i.e., supplementary materials, as provided in the appendix, are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review them. Note that it will not be possible to submit additional separate files as supplementary materials.\n\n\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\n\n  Submissions must adhere to the official ACL style templates which are available as an Overleaf template and also a downloadable directly (Latex and Word). Papers must be in a two-column ACL format and submitted as PDF files.\n  Submission Link: https://openreview.net/group?id=EMNLP/2025/Workshop/WiNLP\n  Submissions must be anonymized for review to ensure fairness.\n  Topics: Submissions can cover a wide range of topics in computational linguistics and NLP, including but not limited to:\n    \n      Safety and alignment in large language models (LLMs)\n      AI/LLM agents\n      Human-AI interaction and cooperation\n      Retrieval-augmented language models\n      Mathematical, symbolic, and logical reasoning in NLP\n      Computational social science and NLP for social good\n      Code models\n      Interpretability, model editing, transparency, and explainability\n      LLM efficiency\n      Generalizability and transfer learning\n      Dialogue and interactive systems\n      Discourse, pragmatics, and reasoning\n      Low-resource methods for NLP\n      Ethics, bias, and fairness\n      Natural language generation\n      Information extraction and retrieval\n      Linguistic theories, cognitive modeling, and psycholinguistics\n      Machine translation\n      Multilinguality and language diversity\n      Multimodality and language grounding (e.g., vision, robotics)\n      Neurosymbolic approaches to NLP\n      Phonology, morphology, and word segmentation\n      Question answering\n      Resources and evaluation\n      Semantics (lexical, sentence-level, textual inference)\n      Sentiment analysis, stylistic analysis, and argument mining\n      Speech processing and spoken language understanding\n      Summarization\n      Hierarchical structure prediction, syntax, and parsing\n      NLP applications\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nMultiple Submission Policy\n\nFor archival papers, WiNLP enforces a strict no multiple submission policy. Such papers submitted to WiNLP must not be under review at another journal, conference, or workshop during the WiNLP submission and review period. This prohibition includes submissions to ACL Rolling Review (ARR) 2025 May and EMNLP 2025. WiNLP submissions should not overlap significantly in content or results with papers that are already published or will be published elsewhere.\n\n\n\nImportant Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 PM UTC-12:00 (“Anywhere on Earth”)\n\n\n  \n    \n      Event\n      Date\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Pre-submission mentoring deadline\n      June 20, 2025\n    \n    \n      Pre-submission feedback returned\n      July 18, 2025\n    \n    \n      Paper submission deadline\n      August 1, 2025\n    \n    \n      Acceptance notifications\n      September 15, 2025\n    \n    \n      Camera-ready deadline\n      October 1, 2025\n    \n    \n      Travel grant applications due\n      September 26, 2025\n    \n    \n      Travel grant notifications\n      October 6, 2025\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nPre-Submission Mentorship Program\n\nWiNLP offers an optional pre-submission mentorship program to help authors improve the quality of their writing and presentation before final submission. The program focuses on enhancing the clarity and structure of the paper, not critiquing the research content.\n\n\n  Submission: Authors must submit a draft of their paper via the designated Google Form (https://forms.gle/J33K2ea6VruN82ke9) by June 20, 2025. The draft should adhere to the same formatting and length guidelines as final submissions.\n  Mentor Assignment: Organizers will check the draft for compliance with formatting requirements before assigning a mentor. The mentor will not be involved in reviewing the final submission.\n  Feedback: Mentors will provide feedback by July 18, 2025, offering suggestions to improve writing and presentation. Authors are encouraged to incorporate this feedback before the final submission deadline.\n  Non-Anonymous: The mentorship process is not anonymized.\n  Final Submission: Authors who participate in the mentorship program should  submit their final paper as a new submission via OpenReview by August 1st, 2025 to be considered for WiNLP workshop. Participation in the mentorship program is not a prerequisite for submitting a paper to WiNLP.\n\n\n\n\nTravel Support\n\nWiNLP offers a limited number of travel grants to support one author per accepted submission. Grants may cover expenses such as registration, travel, lodging, or visa costs. Funded authors may choose to attend virtually if preferred.\n\n\n  Travel grant application deadline: September 26, 2025\n  Notification: October 6, 2025\n  Eligibility: One author per accepted submission is eligible. The funded author must be identified in the travel grant application form.\n\n\nAdditional funding for virtual attendance by other authors may be considered if surplus funds are available, but in-person attendance for additional authors is not guaranteed. Travel expenses are handled via reimbursement (primarily through USD check or PayPal). Authors unable to front travel costs should contact the organizers early to discuss alternatives.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to explore local funding options (e.g., institutional support) to maximize the reach of WiNLP’s limited funds. We recommend additional student authors keep an eye out for the EMNLP call for student volunteers or call for D&amp;I subsidies as opportunities for further funding.\n\n\n\nContact Information\n\n\n  Website: https://www.winlp.org/call-for-submissions-2025/\n  Twitter: @winlpworkshop\n  Facebook: Widening NLP\n  LinkedIn: Widening NLP\n  Email: winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com\n\n",

It aims to promote diversity and highlight the work of underrepresented groups in NLP: anyone who self-identifies within an underrepresented group [based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or otherwise] is invited to submit a two-page abstract for a poster presentation. In our 2024 iteration, we hope to be more intentional about centering discussions of access and disability, as well as contributing to diversity in scientific background, discipline, training, obtained degrees, seniority, and communities from underrepresented languages.\n\nThe full-day event includes invited talks, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice.  It also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs. Most importantly,  the workshop will provide an inclusive and accepting space, and work to lower structural barriers to joining and collaborating with the NLP community at large.\n\nSubmission guidelines\nWhile everyone is encouraged to attend, the opportunity to present a talk or poster is intended for members of underrepresented groups at all career levels: students, post-docs, professors, and other researchers. Since many submissions are works in progress, we act as a non-archival repository for these works: while authors may elect to have their papers linked from our website, they will not be archived in the ACL Anthology. Authors may elect to not have their submission listed on the website if they wish to avoid de-anonymizing themselves for later submissions to other venues.\n\nFor review, submissions must be anonymized and follow the standard two-column format used in past WiNLP workshops. Each submission should be a two-page extended abstract PDF, with any number of additional pages allowed for references. No appendices will be accepted.\n\nSubmissions should be two pages long (not including references). Authors must use the ACL Rolling Review style files to format their submission, and must submit it electronically in PDF format via the WiNLP 2024 online submission system on openreview.\n\nWe invite submissions on topics in computational linguistics and NLP, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  Cognitive modeling and psycholinguistics\n  Computational social science\n  Corpus development and evaluation\n  Dialog and interactive systems\n  Discourse and pragmatics\n  Document analysis including text categorization, topic models, and retrieval\n  Ethics in NLP\n  Natural language generation\n  Information extraction, text mining, and question answering\n  Language-inclusive multimodal integration\n  Linguistic theories for NLP\n  Low-resource or endangered languages\n  Machine learning\n  Machine translation\n  Mathematical models of language\n  Multilinguality\n  Phonology, morphology, and word segmentation\n  Resources and evaluation\n  Semantics\n  Sentiment analysis and opinion mining\n  Social media: Twitter, blogs, discussion forums, and other social media\n  Sociolinguistics\n  Speech, prosody, and spoken dialog\n  Summarization\n  Tagging, chunking, syntax, and parsing\n  Vision, robots, and other grounding applications\n\n\nSubmission link: https://openreview.net/group?id=EMNLP/2024/Workshop/WiNLP\n\nARR style files: https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html#style-files\n\nMultiple Submission Policy\nAs we aim for improved and increased representation of underrepresented minorities, we will consider anonymized two page abstracts of papers that have been submitted to other venues or have already been published elsewhere since August 13, 2023. However, authors must clearly indicate this at submission time in the submission form. While our reviewers are instructed not to seek to de-anonymize submissions, authors from previously published works acknowledge that anonymity may not be guaranteed in those cases should a reviewer recognize their work.\n\nAuthors may NOT submit the same work to both the regular and visa-friendly deadlines. While an author may appear on works in both submission deadlines, they must have substantially distinct content. Submissions to the main deadline deemed to duplicate early submissions will be rejected without review.\n\nACL Rolling Review (ARR)\nAuthors who have work submitted to ARR on or after August 15, 2024 may also submit an extended abstract to the WiNLP workshop. Because our conference accepts two-page abstracts as our primary form of submission, we ask that authors still submit an extended abstract through our Openreview page to ensure every poster has a corresponding two-page abstract. By default, abstracts are listed with their authors on the website, but our accepted abstracts are not archived in the ACL Anthology. Authors may elect to have their abstract linked from the conference website as a camera-ready. If your work is accepted while it should be under anonymity for reviewing purposes, please let us know when we solicit your camera-ready paper if you need your submission to be either unlisted or listed with anonymous authors.\n\nPeer Workshopping and Reviewing Procedure\nTen days prior to the submission deadline, authors will have the option to peer-review each others’ abstracts in a non-anonymous format, in groups of two or three authors. To participate in this process, authors must sign up using this form no less than two weeks before the deadline to which they choose to submit: either June for early review or August for regular review. Authors taking this option commit to help their peers edit and format their submissions, or revise for clarity, or provide general feedback before the submission is reviewed. Authors may use the feedback provided during this peer-editing period to update their submissions in time for the submission deadline. The program committee may still provide reviews, feedback, and direct writing mentorship for applicants, but the intent of peer-editing is to share this responsibility with the participants so that it can scale with the size of the workshop.\n\nWhether or not authors take advantage of this peer-review option in advance of submission, all submissions are due on the deadline (anywhere on earth). After the submission deadline, abstracts will be reviewed in the traditional double-blind format. Abstracts will be evaluated on relevance to the community; the presentation format (talk or poster) will be decided based on scientific merit and potential interest to a broad audience.\n\nTravel Support\nThere will be a limited amount of travel grants and/or additional funding to cover expenses, similar to the previous editions. Financial support will be made available for travel, lodging, registration, and visa costs for one author for each submission, subject to our available funding. The funded author may elect to attend virtually if they prefer. The selected author should be identified as part of the travel grant submission form. If we find ourselves with extra funds, we will attempt to support further funding for virtual attendance for additional authors, but we do not guarantee we can support any further in-person attendance. We recommend additional student authors keep an eye out for the EMNLP call for student volunteers or call for D&amp;I subsidies as opportunities for further funding.\n\nDifferent institutions have different funding availability, so we ask authors to please explore their funding options locally in addition to through WiNLP so we can extend our funds to as many participants as possible. More information will be made available closer to the submission deadline and linked from our workshop website at https://www.winlp.org/winlp-2024-workshop/ . Travel expenses are handled via reimbursement (primarily through $USD check or PayPal). If you will be unable to front the cost of travel expenses and your school or employer is unable to assist, please reach out to the organizers as soon as possible.\n\nContact information\nWebsite: https://www.winlp.org/winlp-2024-workshop/\n\nTwitter: @winlpworkshop\n\nFacebook: Widening NLP\n\nLinkedIn: Widening NLP\n\nE-mail: winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com\n",

    "title": "WiNLP Guidelines for Zoom Moderation",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "These guidelines are intended to help protect all WiNLP attendees and speakers in our Zoom events.\n\nGuidelines for WiNLP attendees:\n\n\n  \n    Do not share the Zoom link with anyone else. All WiNLP attendees will have access to our Zoom link via our registration email, or via the hosting conference workshop/session page. No one who is not either a WiNLP registree nor a hosting conference attendee should attend. Making the link public, in any way, opens you up to Zoom-bombing and other malicious activity by outside trolls.\n  \n  \n    Please ensure your Zoom name matches your registration. This helps chairs or volunteers easily catch non-registered attendees.\n  \n  \n    Ask us for help if you need it. Should you encounter disruptive behavior by an attendee, there are several steps you can take. Please keep in mind the following:\n    \n      For panels, a WiNLP chair or volunteer will be present in the Zoom session. You may post a note in the Zoom chat requesting assistance. (If you feel uncomfortable with the chat message being seen by all participants, you may use the private message function.)  You can also call a WiNLP volunteer or chair by putting a note requesting assistance with a link to your Zoom room in the WiNLP Slack channel #incidents. If the host conference has a RocketChat, you can likewise call a conference volunteer by putting a note in the RocketChat #incidents channel. (Precise channel name per hosting conference to be determined and communicated prior to each event.) The volunteers, on arrival, will have co-host permissions in the Zoom room.\n      If you are not comfortable taking these actions yourself, you can call on a WiNLP chair or conference volunteer to assist.\n      These are only for cases of disruptive behavior, and are not to be used, for example, merely in case of scientific disagreement.\n      Any author or volunteer who finds it necessary to deploy one of these ‘silencing’ options should report that fact to the WiNLP chairs, immediately upon the conclusion of the session, via Slack or email (winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com). You can and should also report the incident to the hosting conference’s PCC co-chairs, but if you do not feel comfortable doing so directly, the WiNLP chairs will help funnel that reporting.\n    \n  \n\n\nGuidelines for WiNLP chairs &amp; volunteers:\n\n\n  A chair or volunteer must be assigned to monitor the WiNLP Slack #incidents channel throughout the session, for potential incident reports.\n  A chair or volunteer must be assigned to be in the WiNLP Zoom session to monitor directly for potential harassment incidents.\n\n\nSteps for Active Moderation, for attendees &amp; volunteers:\n\nWe encourage you to take the minimal action that manages the disruption.Possible actions to handle a disruptive participant:\n\n\n  Mute the participant. This can be done via the Participants pane. At this point, it is also a good idea to uncheck the option that allows participants to unmute themselves.\n  Move the participant to the waiting room. If a participant continues to be disruptive despite being muted (e.g. via the chat), you can move them to the waiting room. This can be done even if the waiting room isn’t ‘enabled’, but it may be valuable to enable it at this point, in case the person tries to leave and reenter. Anyone with host or co-host privileges can send messages to the waiting room, but it is not possible to communicate with people in the waiting room via individual chat.\n  Remove the participant. This prevents the participant from easily coming back into the room.\n\n",

Anyone who violates these standards may be sanctioned or expelled from this Slack community at the discretion of the WiNLP Chairs.\n\nThis is a “living” document, and will be changed as WiNLP Chairs see fit. We will notify the group whenever changes are made.\n\n\n\n\n  Be respectful: Treat all community members with respect. Express your opinions kindly and respectfully.\n  Be polite: Be mindful of excessive posting or spamming. Know that all-caps may be read as YELLING! And yelling at someone is usually not very nice.\n  Report concerns: Please don’t “name and shame” other members of the community publicly. We are here to help; if you have an argument or unpleasant encounter with someone, please contact an individual WiNLP chair or email winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com. If the person who is harassing you is a volunteer or organizer, or they have a conflict of interest, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. All reports will be handled promptly and in the strictest confidence. We also believe that people can address and change their behaviors through self-work. The organizers can discuss a person’s development and make decisions on a case-by-case basis.\n  Maintain privacy: Do not share your account information with anyone. We will never ask for your password. Do not post personal information (phone numbers, email addresses, passwords, account information, physical addresses, first and last names, etc) about yourself or others.\n  Do not harass anyone.

    "title": "Sponsor Policy",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "Sponsors provide key support for our organization to fund travel, lodging, registration, and bandwidth expenses for our presenters, attendees, and volunteers coordinating our event, including guaranteeing travel and registration for at least one author of each submission to the conference. In 2021, approximately 95% of our event costs were associated with these expenses, with the remaining 5% used for online event hosting, translation, and captioning services.\n\nThis year, we have updated our sponsorship policy to reduce our sponsors to two tiers: major sponsors and supporting sponsors. The expected sponsorship fee associated with each tier is now determined as a function of the size of the company based on reported number of employees.\n\nDetermining Sponsors\n\nOur primary list of proposed sponsors is determined every year by combining the list of sponsors from the previous years with sponsors nominated by board members or workshop organizers. If multiple board members or organizers are concerned about a sponsor on that list, that sponsor is put forward for discussion by the board and chairs. Ultimately, the organizers for that year vote on whether to remove that sponsor from consideration, with a majority consensus required of organizers required to reject a particular sponsor.\n\nThe sponsor selection process is carried out at least five months prior to the workshop. If an opportunity arises later to connect with a sponsor not on the selected list, they may be added by consulting the chairs and board members and verifying there are no objections. If any board member or chair objects, then the sponsor will not be considered until the following year.\n\nSponsorship Tiers\n\nWe have moved to a tier structure that factors in the size of for-profit organizations (based on number of employees) to determine the amount of funds for a sponsor to be a major versus a supporting sponsor. We summarize the contribution amounts and benefits below.\n\n\n  \n    \n       \n      Small (&lt;500 employees)\n      Mid (500-5000 employees)\n      Large (5000+ employees)\n      Non-profit (any size)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Major Sponsor\n      $5,000\n      $10,000\n      $20,000\n      $5,000\n    \n    \n      Supporting Sponsor\n      $2,500\n      $5,000\n      $10,000\n      $2,500 or in-kind support\n    \n  \n\n\nSponsorship tiers for varying sizes of companies.\n\nMajor Sponsor:\n\n\n  Large logo and hyperlink on the website, large logo in proceedings, large logo in pause screen between presentations and sessions\n  3 company representatives at networking and mentorship lunch\n  A list of participants who have opted in to share contact information, for networking/job search purposes\n  Acknowledgement at the beginning and end of the workshop\n  Individual exhibition/recruiting table\n\n\nSupporting Sponsor:\n\n\n  Medium logo and hyperlink on the website, small logo in proceedings\n  1 company representative at networking and mentorship lunch\n  A list of participants who have opted in to share contact information, for networking/job search purposes\n  Acknowledgement at the beginning and end of the workshop\n  Individual exhibition/recruiting table\n\n\nNote: the networking and mentorship lunch will be an opportunity for company representatives/recruiters to mingle with workshop participants and speakers in a casual environment. More details will be communicated at a later date.\n\nAdditional sponsor options\n\nIn-kind sponsorship\n\nBoth in the past and moving forward, we are happy to accept other types of donations as forms of material support from our sponsors. Sponsors providing support through these channels who are not otherwise marked in one of the financial tiers above will be listed as “In Kind Sponsors” on our materials and are eligible to receive the following benefits:\n\n\n  Small logo and hyperlink on the website, small logo in proceedings\n  A list of participants who have opted in to share contact information, for networking/job search purposes\n  Acknowledgement at the beginning and end of the workshop\n\n\nSome examples of ways that sponsors have or can support WiNLP include:\n\n\n  Helping to front costs or book flights directly for a small number of attendees, as they often cannot afford to wait for reimbursement.\n  Lending laptops and other hardware so that authors who are unable to attain visas or travel can still present their work virtually, through the screen.\n  Offering books as “best paper” prizes.\n  Offering free software codes for technologies that help with research tasks (e.g., cloud computing or writing).\n  Arranging for (human) live transcription or translation for accessibility.\n  Offering legal visa assistance for authors needing to navigate travel visa requirements.\n  Sponsored sub-events or activities at or associated with a WiNLP-hosted event, such as a sponsored lunch for participants, or a sponsor-led tutorial session.\n\n\nNotices of sponsorship limitations\n\nOur events often include invited researchers as speakers, including those who are part of our sponsoring organizations. However, we treat our selection of these speakers as independent of our selection of sponsors. We generally do not solicit lists of suggested speakers from companies and expect that speakers from sponsor companies will primarily direct their talk to their own work and lived experiences instead of recruitment efforts.\n\nWe have recently developed a sponsorship selection process that allows our board members and chairs to weigh in about prospective sponsors and offer concerns, culminating in an opportunity for current chairs to vote on sponsors. To remove a sponsor from consideration requires a two-thirds majority of chairs to vote against them as a sponsor. Sponsors who receive this invitation have already been approved by this process for 2022.\n\nWhile we are happy to share these sub-events that are in conjunction with EMNLP 2022 or Widening NLP 2022 with our attendees, we will include a disclaimer on our website and advertisements for such events with the following:\n\nWidening NLP does not endorse the sponsors of our workshop as employers, nor do we endorse the views they express or the products/services they offer. We are grateful for their sponsorship of our programs and we encourage our participants to do their own research into these organizations.\n\nIf you are interested in being a sponsor and have not heard from Widening NLP previously, please reach out to us at winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com. We look forward to hearing from you.\n\n",

    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "Afra Alishahi\n\n\n\nI am an associate professor at Tilburg University, the Netherlands. My research focuses on applying computational techniques for modeling human cognition, specifically human language acquisition and processing. I was born in Tehran, Iran, where I lived till 2002. I was always interested in Math. Towards the end of high school, a favorite cousin of mine talked me into studying “computers”. There was no real computer science program offered in Iran when I started the university, so I did a bachelor’s in software engineering and then a master’s in artificial intelligence before moving to Canada to do a PhD in computer science at the University of Toronto.\n\nOver the course of my scientific career, I have worked on modeling several aspects of child language development, including the acquisition of words, lexical categories and argument structure constructions in monolingual and bilingual communities. More recently I have been working on grounded models of language learning from naturalistic input (raw speech and naturalistic images). I believe my research, as well as others who work on similar topics, has contributed to our understanding of child language acquisition, and also brought cognitive models of language more into focus in the NLP community in recent years. What I find challenging in NLP research is to keep up with the pace with which the field moves forward, but at the same time it keeps us alert and makes our research more exciting.\n\nIn my own field I suspect the next trend to be unsupervised learning of language from more realistic multimodal input such as video, situated in interactive environments. Much effort in NLP research is put into developing models and techniques that provide better results, but quantitative and qualitative analysis of what models actually learn does not receive enough attention. I hope more researchers focus on understanding the nature of linguistic knowledge learned by computational models.\n\nPascale Fung’s Human Language Technology Center\n\n\n\nI co-founded the Human Language Technology Center back in 1997, 20 years ago. This is a joint center between the departments of Electronic and Computer Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. We work on multilingual, multimodal and interactive aspects of speech and language processing. In particular, we were the first group who worked on accented Mandarin speech recognition and colloquial Chinese language understanding. We built the first Chinese natural language search engine back in 2001 and the first Chinese language virtual assistant on the smartphone in 2010. We also work on code-switching in speech and language modeling. More recently, we have been focusing on building interactive systems with both traditional spoken language understanding and an additional empathy module.\n\nThe group has always been diverse with current students from China, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Korea, the Netherlands, and Italy, even though the norm for engineering groups in Hong Kong is for the majority of students to be from mainland China. So far, the group had 8-9 women graduate students, and a number of women undergraduate project students. With more cross-disciplinary topics, I find that I am getting more female students who are interested in our area.\n\nComputational linguistics is both a science, where many linguists attempt to discover the underlying structures of languages, and engineering, where many others attempt to build AI systems that complete some tasks. A corollary of this challenge is that it is difficult to find students who excel in NLP – most are either interested in linguistics or in engineering. The kind of work we do in my group has always needed good engineers who nevertheless have some intuitions and insights about languages, if not linguistics per se. I find that having groups of students with diverse backgrounds working together definitely helps though, as some of them are more mathematically-inclined, others are better software engineers, and yet others are more intuitive and creative. These traits are not mutually exclusive of course, but it is harder to find individual students who possess all of them. Students who came from different cultural backgrounds went through different education systems which often trained them to be stronger in one of these areas.\n\nI am most proud of the kind of work we have done that have “gone where no man has gone before” – they were not mainstream at the time, but became more important later on. One early example was using signal processing for language processing, another example is code switch speech, the other multilingual language processing. Although much of our non-mainstream work paid off later on, there can be issues with being taken seriously initially. For instance, groups that are based in North America have more media exposure and access to policy makers. We have to make more of an effort to affect impact on the global stage. It can be done, however, through persistence.\n\nGroup members in the photo, in alphabetical order:\n\nDario Bertero, Chao Xianjin, Anik Dey, Akanksha Gupta (undergrad project student), Onno Kampman, Nayeon Lee, Naziba Mostafa, Ji Ho Park, Qi Zihao, Jaemin Shin, Farhad Bin Siddique, Genta Indra Winata, Xu Peng, Emily Yang\n\nVarada Kolhatkar\n\n\n\nI was born in Pune, India. I came to the U.S. to do my M.Sc. in computer science at the University of Minnesota, Duluth and then moved to Canada for my Ph.D. in computational linguistics at the University of Toronto. I am now a postdoctoral researcher at Simon Fraser University.\n\nI did not really think very deeply when I started my undergraduate degree in computer science. I always thought very highly of people who devoted their lives to solve hard problems and I wanted to be one of them. So I decided to pursue my Masters. My Masters advisor, Ted Pedersen, introduced me to NLP. I was fascinated by the countless research opportunities in the field and decided to pursue a Ph.D. in NLP. Currently, I am working on developing computational methods for analyzing online text, in particular, reader comments posted on news articles. I have also worked on anonymizing unstructured data, anaphora resolution, and word-sense disambiguation.\n\nI think deeper analysis from the perspective of understanding language is not getting much attention in the field. In our papers, we say which features work well and which do not by carrying out ablation experiments. But we only provide relatively superficial explanations. We see many papers with sophisticated models that work well. But there is no deeper analysis of why these models work so well and what kind of linguistic characteristics these models are capturing. I also feel that proper evaluation does not get enough attention. I believe one of the next topics to get more attention will be filtering toxic text on the web, discourse processing, and argumentation mining.\n\nI like the work I’ve done so far but the proud moment has yet to come. I feel that finding an appropriate job and building a network is one of the main challenges for an early-career professional in NLP, which is probably shared by all early career researchers, not just women or other minority groups. I hope that initiatives like WiNLP will help tackle barriers for early-career professionals in NLP, especially women and other underrepresented groups in the field.\n\nBarbara Plank\n\n\n\nI am an assistant professor at the University of Groningen. Much of my work focuses on building Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that are more robust: that work better on unexpected inputs (like new domains and languages) and can be trained from semi-automatically or weakly annotated data from a variety of sources. This includes leveraging what I call fortuitous data: sources that so far have been neglected or rest in non-obvious places.\n\nI grew up in a German-speaking minority in the North of Italy. After attending a commercial high school, I studied computer science in Bozen-Bolzano, despite many suggesting me to go abroad and study economics. During my CS bachelor studies I took an introductory class in computational linguistics, and immediately got hooked: finally the studies were no longer about software engineering, interfaces and databases, but about language, with all the fascinating challenges that come with it. I then did the Language and Communication Technologies (LCT) European Masters Program, as one of its first students, which brought me to Amsterdam.\n\nThroughout my academic career, I am proud that I have had the opportunity to learn from and work with many great and inspiring people in the field across Europe (Denmark, Italy and The Netherlands). I am also proud that I co-taught a summer course at last year’s ESSLLI at the very same university I graduated from nine years earlier. And finally, I am proud of being tenured at the age of 33.\n\nI think one of the hottest research directions in NLP will be, and already is, transfer learning, the ability to transfer models to new conditions, which includes learning under limited (or absence of) annotated resources. As a matter of fact most current approaches need abundant amounts of labeled training data, and work well only in benchmarking scenarios: when future data comes from the same distribution.\n\nWhat currently doesn’t get enough attention in NLP is evaluation. This includes both in-depth and thorough studies that shed light on why certain approaches do (or do not) work, as well as work that questions established evaluation measures. Such work is typically hard to publish.\n\nZornitsa Kozareva\n\n\n\nI am a Manager of the AWS Deep Learning group at Amazon that solves and builds natural language processing and dialogue applications. Previously, I was a Senior Manager at Yahoo! leading the Query Understanding and User Intent group that powered Mobile Search and Advertisement. Before that I wore an academic hat as a Research Professor at the University of Southern California CS Department with affiliation to Information Sciences Institute, where I spearheaded research funded by DARPA and IARPA on learning to read, interpreting metaphors and building knowledge bases from the Web. My interests lie in building intelligent NLP systems that scale to billions of data points, work across different domains and verticals, and most importantly solve real world problems for the end user.\n\nSince I was a little kid, I was very curious and passionate about science, I would regularly participate in math and physics Olympiads. My interest in Natural Language Processing began in 2003, when I was doing my undergraduate studies in computer science and was selected to conduct research at the New University of Lisbon and work on Multilingual Information Retrieval. I was mesmerized by the power of machine learning and its ability to solve natural language problems. From that moment, I knew that I wanted to work in this area and contribute towards scientific breakthroughs.\n\nThroughout my career, I feel extremely lucky to have worked with and learned from great leaders and visionaries such as Eduard Hovy, Jerry Hobbs, Ellen Riloff, Kevin Knight, Rada Mihalcea, Manuel Palomar, Andres Montoyo, Dimitar Mekerov among others. I was fortunate to be surrounded by so many smart people, from whom I learned a lot both as a mentee and a mentor. I feel honored that in 2016, I was awarded the John Atanasoff Award, one of the highest recognitions given by the President of Republic of Bulgaria for my contributions and impact in science, education, and industry.\n\nI think one challenge in NLP is that sometimes methods and algorithms that are shown to work well on small datasets lead to misconceptions that a particular problem is solved. However in practice, it is really hard to develop practical solutions that work and solve real world problems at a large scale.\n\nOne area I am particularly excited about is open domain multi-modal conversational assistants that can understand and help humans in their daily lives. I think this research area will receive a lot of attention in the coming years. I envision such dialog systems to be personalized, context-aware with the capability of automatically learning about new intents directly from human conversations.\n\nYuki Arase\n\n\n\nI am an associate professor at Osaka University, born in Tokushima, a small city in Japan. I work on phrase alignment, which can be applied for phrasal paraphrase and parallel phrase detection. More recently, I have also started working on conversation systems in collaboration with the team at Microsoft Research Asia who developed the popular chat-bot service Rinna. I see the future of NLP in advanced automatic conversation systems that really understand us.\n\nI have always been interested in understanding human minds, in how people perceive the world and what is the mechanism of thinking are. When I was a high school student, there was a social boom on intelligent robots, like the recent AI enthusiasm, where computer science plays an important. That strongly motivated me to study computer science at university.\nFor my Ph.D., I focused on my interests in human’s perception through research on user interfaces for mobile devices. After graduation, I joined Microsoft Research Asia as an associate researcher, where I had the opportunity to explore all research fields in MSRA and find out what I truly want to work on thanks to my line manager. I ended up with NLP, following my natural interests of understanding the mechanisms of thinking.\nWhat I find challenging as a researcher that is not unique in NLP is a gap between product development and research. To deliver something valuable to people, we should use practical, sustainable, and scalable approaches to achieve goals, which are not necessarily academically appealing to researchers.\nWe further put excessive emphasis on numbers, i.e., scores on precision or BLEU, but neglect analysing data and outputs to understand research problems.\n\nOne of the strategies I have seen female computer scientists use to try and fit in is, intentionally or unintentionally, hiding preferences or characteristics thought of as a being stereotypically female to feel “included” in a male-centric community. For instance, following the stereotype of a hardworking male researcher, staying in the lab until late despite being tired and pretending not to be interested in anything apart from work. On a superficial level this works, but might lead to a feeling of losing one’s true self. And worse, we may distance ourselves from female friends who are members of more balanced communities for behaving differently from their male counterparts. Increasing diversity in a community and promoting minorities through initiatives such as this workshop does help to change such situations, but it will take time. In the meantime, it is important to keep friends across communities to have a place to behave naturally.\n\nNatalie Schluter\n\n\n\nI was born in Vancouver, but now live in Denmark, where I’m Assistant Professor at the IT University of Copenhagen. As part of my role, I helped establish and now act as the Head of the first Data Science BSc Program in Denmark. This is a busy and thrilling part of my job where I directly help shape the data science competency pool in Denmark.\n\nMy focus is on algorithms for NLP: theoretical and linguistic power and resource complexity, especially for semantic processing. My research often carries a good portion of mathematical content. This is a central challenge, both for my individual contributions at the review stage and for finding people to collaborate with, because NLP researchers don’t have much patience for mathematics these days.\n\nRelated to this is the growing problem of recent state-of-the-art learning architectures that are prohibitively expensive to train, leaving many important contributions in NLP unverifiable by most of the research community. I think the next hot topic will have to be on improving these big architectures with more focus on experiment methodology and computational complexity: verifiability, truth, feasibility and sustainability.\n\nI have several different degrees, which I worked really hard for and am quite proud of. At university, I wanted to study mathematics, but had a stronger desire to travel. That is when I started getting more interested in the structure of language. When I started studying math at UBC, Vancouver, I also took some linguistics courses, and then switched over to linguistics, finishing my first BA in this. Desiring to understand the mathematics better, I then went to Montréal and finished a BSc in Mathematics. However, I felt a Linguistics pang and then finished an MSc in Linguistics also at the University of Montréal. Of course, I then felt a pang for more mathematics and went on to finish an MSc in Mathematics at Trinity College, University of Dublin, Ireland. Natural language processing was a good field in which to reconcile my interests. I completed a PhD in Natural Language Processing at Dublin City University.\n\nSurprisingly, my education is problematic for many, some inferring that I kept switching degrees because I was not very good at any one thing or was confused. I’ve even got “her background is, well… broad” as a dismissing and the only remark in a formal presentation of my research in front of group of peers. I believe that the perception of my academic achievements has been negative because I am a woman, black or both. Rather than being a couple random examples of our careers as minorities, such incidents are (always surprisingly) frequent. I believe that there is little awareness of their pervasiveness and if there were, the vast majority of the NLP community would support initiatives like WiNLP. However, WiNLP is in virtue of its name a closed community. We need broader community-wide outreach.\n\nDong Nguyen\n\n\n\nI am a research fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, researching large-scale text analysis to shed light on social and cultural phenomena. Much of my work focuses on the social aspects of language use and fits within the emerging area of computational sociolinguistics. I am also very interested in methodological issues that arise with interdisciplinary research and specifically the interaction between ML/NLP and the social sciences.\n\nI grew up in Deventer, in the Netherlands. I already had access to a computer as a kid as my father had studied computer science. My first exposure to programming was a programming language designed for kids to control the movements of a turtle on a screen. Later on during high school I got very interested in web design. Despite that, I first started studying biomedical engineering, partly because I was put off by misleading computer science stereotypes. After one year I fortunately changed my mind and switched to computer science.\n\nDuring my studies, an award targeting minorities in the Netherlands gave me the opportunity to attend a summer school at UCLA in the second year of my undergraduate, where I attended a course in linguistics. Inspired by this, I pursued a Master’s degree at the Language Technologies Institute at CMU. Despite the incredible experience and the possibility to continue as a PhD student, I decided to do my PhD closer to home, at the University of Twente. This was a very difficult decision for me. At the time I valued the prestige of institutions a lot and quite some people advised against my move. However, this turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made, enabling me to maintain a work-life balance that I am happy with.\n\nI think computational sociolinguistics will be, or already is, one of the hottest areas in natural language processing. One of my proudest achievements so far has been an article published in Computational Linguistics, surveying the area of computational sociolinguistics, which I hope will become a useful resource. I also think that the interpretability and validation of NLP models will become more important in some domains, especially given the ongoing discussions regarding ethics, fairness etc. and the increasing societal impact of NLP.\n\nI have found the NLP community to be very welcoming and initiatives like WiNLP great to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups.\n\nOne big challenge I see in NLP is that there seems to be an almost exclusive focus on task performance, measuring the quality of the models using abstract metrics. Analysis studies are often undervalued and difficult to publish, although thorough, insightful analyses are valuable and difficult to carry out.\n\nWei Xu\n\n\n\nI am an assistant professor in Computer Science at Ohio State University. I do research on semantics, social media data and natural language generation. I am extremely interested in the intersection of these three areas — paraphrases!\n\nWhen I was a PhD student at New York University, I was intrigued by how many different and creative ways people can use language to express the same meaning especially in user-generated text on Twitter. I switched my PhD research from information extraction to the less-studied paraphrase acquisition problem. Unlike many NLP systems that frustratingly do not get close to human performance, the models I built often surprise and excite me by exceeding the paraphrasing capabilities of native speakers, from “Ezekiel Ansah wearing 3D glasses wout the lens” to “Ezekiel Ansah is wearing 3D movie glasses with the lenses knocked out”. So I was determined to design better models to capture all possible paraphrases, and create useful paraphrase data resources to support all other NLP researchers and applications.\n\nFor my postdoc, I moved to the University of Pennsylvania in 2014. I started to deepen in the second branch of paraphrase research — generation. I decided to take on the text simplification task as it is more technically challenging than sentence compression and practically useful for education applications. At the time, I was already very confident with my technical skills but struggled to push the MT system performance on the simplification task. There must be something wrong, I thought, either in the data or evaluation. It turned out to be both. I wrote a TACL paper in 2015 to show the state-of-the-art setup was not right for simplification using Simple Wikipedia data since 2010. I was relieved when Shashi Narayan, who held the then best performing system, told me that it was great and he shared the same concerns. I felt I did justice to many researchers who worked on simplification and likely struggled for months, and PhD students who had to abandon their projects. This is what motivates me to work, besides my students.\n\n#IMHO The biggest challenge in NLP (and academia in general) is how to maintain high-quality peer review and reward quality work beyond numbers of publications, especially when the field is exploding. Additional efforts are also needed in its globalization. When I was an area chair for EMNLP, even as a native Chinese speaker I felt it was difficult to recruit program committee members from Chinese names in their English spellings. I am sure similar challenges apply to Vietnamese and some other nationalities.\n\nMartha Palmer\n\n\n\nI am a professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I research abstract representations that can consistently and effectively capture key elements of meaning.\n\nI grew up in Houston, TX and discovered my passion for CS as a Math major at the U of Texas while taking an Introduction to CS course. We fed punch cards into the CDC 66/6400 in the basement of Pearce Hall. What I liked the most was that the compiler found all my careless mistakes for me!\nI changed my major to Philosophy since there was no CS undergraduate major at the time. After spending a year in a Psychology Ph.D. program, I quickly switched back to an MA in CS, with Robert Simmons (semantic networks) as my advisor. Subsequently, I received my Ph.D. from Edinburgh University, where I was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. from the AI Department in 1985.\n\nMy biggest achievements in NLP research include the integration of semantic and pragmatic processing that I spearheaded for the PUNDIT/Kernel system in the 80s, as well as leading the development of PropBank, VerbNet and AMRs. While semantics is currently a hot topic, I anticipate that conversational speech that actually works will get more attention in the years to come. I hope that the importance of semantic representations and speaker and hearer discourse models will be recognized as foundational work for this.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges NLP professionals currently face, in my experience, is that algorithms and mathematical approaches, basically quantitative approaches, receive most of the credit in NLP research. I see this bias in favor of mathematical solutions as a type of barrier in the NLP community. Even though studying how to develop and formalize abstract semantic representations is every bit as difficult, challenging and important as studying new algorithms, if not more so, it is rarely recognized.\n",
