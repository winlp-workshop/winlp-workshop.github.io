        "content": "A pot still is a type of still used in distilling spirits such as whisky or brandy. Heat is applied directly to the pot containing the wash (for whisky) or wine (for brandy). This is called a batch distillation (as opposed to a continuous distillation).\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, alcohol boils at 78 °C (172 °F), while water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). During distillation, the vapour contains more alcohol than the liquid. When the vapours are condensed, the resulting liquid contains a higher concentration of alcohol. In the pot still, the alcohol and water vapour combine with esters and flow from the still through the condensing coil. There they condense into the first distillation liquid, the so-called “low wines”. The low wines have a strength of about 25–35% alcohol by volume, and flow into a second still. It is then distilled a second time to produce the colourless spirit, collected at about 70% alcohol by volume. Colour is added through maturation in an oak aging barrel, and develops over time.\n\nThe modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.\n",

    "title": "WiNLP 2025 Workshop - Call for Papers",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "\n\nWorkshop Description\n\nThe Widening NLP (WiNLP) workshop aims to foster an inclusive environment that highlights the contributions of researchers from underrepresented groups in NLP. Anyone who self-identifies as being from an underrepresented background—based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, disability, or otherwise—is encouraged to submit. In 2025, WiNLP will continue placing emphasis on access, disability, and diversity across scientific backgrounds, disciplines, training, and underrepresented languages.\n\nOur annual Widening Natural Language Processing Workshop (WiNLP) will be held in conjunction with EMNLP 2025 in Suzhou, China. Since EMNLP is anticipating a hybrid format for their conference, we also anticipate our workshop will be hybrid, with both online and in-person attendees. The one-day workshop will occur during EMNLP’s workshop period with an exact date to be announced soon.\n\nThe full-day event includes invited talks, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice.  It also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs. Most importantly,  the workshop will provide an inclusive and accepting space, and work to lower structural barriers to joining and collaborating with the NLP community at large.\n\n\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nWhile everyone is encouraged to attend, the opportunity to present a talk or poster is intended for members of underrepresented groups at all career levels: students, post-docs, professors, and other researchers.\n\nSubmissions are invited in two categories:\n\n\n  Thesis Proposals: Designed for graduate students (Master’s or PhD) to present their research plans and receive constructive feedback.\n  Research Papers: Encompasses both work-in-progress with preliminary results and completed research.\n\n\nSubmissions in both categories can be either:\n\n\n  Short Papers: Up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendices. An additional content page is permitted upon acceptance (maximum 5 pages).\n  Extended Abstracts: Up to 2 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendices. An additional content page is permitted upon acceptance (maximum 3 pages).\n\n\nAuthors of short papers may choose whether their submission is archival or non-archival. Archival Papers will be published in the EMNLP 2025 WiNLP Proceedings. Non-Archival Papers can be submitted to other venues in the future, except for another WiNLP workshop. Note, however, paper submissions must be fully self-contained, i.e., supplementary materials, as provided in the appendix, are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review them. Note that it will not be possible to submit additional separate files as supplementary materials.\n\n\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\n\n  Submissions must adhere to the official ACL style templates which are available as an Overleaf template and also a downloadable directly (Latex and Word). Papers must be in a two-column ACL format and submitted as PDF files.\n  Submission Link: https://openreview.net/group?id=EMNLP/2025/Workshop/WiNLP\n  Submissions must be anonymized for review to ensure fairness.\n  Topics: Submissions can cover a wide range of topics in computational linguistics and NLP, including but not limited to:\n    \n      Safety and alignment in large language models (LLMs)\n      AI/LLM agents\n      Human-AI interaction and cooperation\n      Retrieval-augmented language models\n      Mathematical, symbolic, and logical reasoning in NLP\n      Computational social science and NLP for social good\n      Code models\n      Interpretability, model editing, transparency, and explainability\n      LLM efficiency\n      Generalizability and transfer learning\n      Dialogue and interactive systems\n      Discourse, pragmatics, and reasoning\n      Low-resource methods for NLP\n      Ethics, bias, and fairness\n      Natural language generation\n      Information extraction and retrieval\n      Linguistic theories, cognitive modeling, and psycholinguistics\n      Machine translation\n      Multilinguality and language diversity\n      Multimodality and language grounding (e.g., vision, robotics)\n      Neurosymbolic approaches to NLP\n      Phonology, morphology, and word segmentation\n      Question answering\n      Resources and evaluation\n      Semantics (lexical, sentence-level, textual inference)\n      Sentiment analysis, stylistic analysis, and argument mining\n      Speech processing and spoken language understanding\n      Summarization\n      Hierarchical structure prediction, syntax, and parsing\n      NLP applications\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nMultiple Submission Policy\n\nFor archival papers, WiNLP enforces a strict no multiple submission policy. Such papers submitted to WiNLP must not be under review at another journal, conference, or workshop during the WiNLP submission and review period. This prohibition includes submissions to ACL Rolling Review (ARR) 2025 May and EMNLP 2025. WiNLP submissions should not overlap significantly in content or results with papers that are already published or will be published elsewhere.\n\n\n\nImportant Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 PM UTC-12:00 (“Anywhere on Earth”)\n\n\n  \n    \n      Event\n      Date\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Pre-submission mentoring deadline\n      June 20, 2025\n    \n    \n      Pre-submission feedback returned\n      July 18, 2025\n    \n    \n      Paper submission deadline\n      August 1, 2025\n    \n    \n      Acceptance notifications\n      September 15, 2025\n    \n    \n      Camera-ready deadline\n      October 1, 2025\n    \n    \n      Travel grant applications due\n      September 26, 2025\n    \n    \n      Travel grant notifications\n      October 6, 2025\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nPre-Submission Mentorship Program\n\nWiNLP offers an optional pre-submission mentorship program to help authors improve the quality of their writing and presentation before final submission. The program focuses on enhancing the clarity and structure of the paper, not critiquing the research content.\n\n\n  Submission: Authors must submit a draft of their paper via the designated Google Form (https://forms.gle/J33K2ea6VruN82ke9) by June 20, 2025. The draft should adhere to the same formatting and length guidelines as final submissions.\n  Mentor Assignment: Organizers will check the draft for compliance with formatting requirements before assigning a mentor. The mentor will not be involved in reviewing the final submission.\n  Feedback: Mentors will provide feedback by July 18, 2025, offering suggestions to improve writing and presentation. Authors are encouraged to incorporate this feedback before the final submission deadline.\n  Non-Anonymous: The mentorship process is not anonymized.\n  Final Submission: Authors who participate in the mentorship program should  submit their final paper as a new submission via OpenReview by August 1st, 2025 to be considered for WiNLP workshop. Participation in the mentorship program is not a prerequisite for submitting a paper to WiNLP.\n\n\n\n\nTravel Support\n\nWiNLP offers a limited number of travel grants to support one author per accepted submission. Grants may cover expenses such as registration, travel, lodging, or visa costs. Funded authors may choose to attend virtually if preferred.\n\n\n  Travel grant application deadline: September 26, 2025\n  Notification: October 6, 2025\n  Eligibility: One author per accepted submission is eligible. The funded author must be identified in the travel grant application form.\n\n\nAdditional funding for virtual attendance by other authors may be considered if surplus funds are available, but in-person attendance for additional authors is not guaranteed. Travel expenses are handled via reimbursement (primarily through USD check or PayPal). Authors unable to front travel costs should contact the organizers early to discuss alternatives.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to explore local funding options (e.g., institutional support) to maximize the reach of WiNLP’s limited funds. We recommend additional student authors keep an eye out for the EMNLP call for student volunteers or call for D&amp;I subsidies as opportunities for further funding.\n\n\n\nContact Information\n\n\n  Website: https://www.winlp.org/call-for-submissions-2025/\n  Twitter: @winlpworkshop\n  Facebook: Widening NLP\n  LinkedIn: Widening NLP\n  Email: winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com\n\n",

It aims to promote diversity and highlight the work of underrepresented groups in NLP: anyone who self-identifies within an underrepresented group [based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or otherwise] is invited to submit a two-page abstract for a poster presentation. In our 2024 iteration, we hope to be more intentional about centering discussions of access and disability, as well as contributing to diversity in scientific background, discipline, training, obtained degrees, seniority, and communities from underrepresented languages.\n\nThe full-day event includes invited talks, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice.  It also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs. Most importantly,  the workshop will provide an inclusive and accepting space, and work to lower structural barriers to joining and collaborating with the NLP community at large.\n\nSubmission guidelines\nWhile everyone is encouraged to attend, the opportunity to present a talk or poster is intended for members of underrepresented groups at all career levels: students, post-docs, professors, and other researchers. Since many submissions are works in progress, we act as a non-archival repository for these works: while authors may elect to have their papers linked from our website, they will not be archived in the ACL Anthology. Authors may elect to not have their submission listed on the website if they wish to avoid de-anonymizing themselves for later submissions to other venues.\n\nFor review, submissions must be anonymized and follow the standard two-column format used in past WiNLP workshops. Each submission should be a two-page extended abstract PDF, with any number of additional pages allowed for references. No appendices will be accepted.\n\nSubmissions should be two pages long (not including references). Authors must use the ACL Rolling Review style files to format their submission, and must submit it electronically in PDF format via the WiNLP 2024 online submission system on openreview.\n\nWe invite submissions on topics in computational linguistics and NLP, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  Cognitive modeling and psycholinguistics\n  Computational social science\n  Corpus development and evaluation\n  Dialog and interactive systems\n  Discourse and pragmatics\n  Document analysis including text categorization, topic models, and retrieval\n  Ethics in NLP\n  Natural language generation\n  Information extraction, text mining, and question answering\n  Language-inclusive multimodal integration\n  Linguistic theories for NLP\n  Low-resource or endangered languages\n  Machine learning\n  Machine translation\n  Mathematical models of language\n  Multilinguality\n  Phonology, morphology, and word segmentation\n  Resources and evaluation\n  Semantics\n  Sentiment analysis and opinion mining\n  Social media: Twitter, blogs, discussion forums, and other social media\n  Sociolinguistics\n  Speech, prosody, and spoken dialog\n  Summarization\n  Tagging, chunking, syntax, and parsing\n  Vision, robots, and other grounding applications\n\n\nSubmission link: https://openreview.net/group?id=EMNLP/2024/Workshop/WiNLP\n\nARR style files: https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html#style-files\n\nMultiple Submission Policy\nAs we aim for improved and increased representation of underrepresented minorities, we will consider anonymized two page abstracts of papers that have been submitted to other venues or have already been published elsewhere since August 13, 2023. However, authors must clearly indicate this at submission time in the submission form. While our reviewers are instructed not to seek to de-anonymize submissions, authors from previously published works acknowledge that anonymity may not be guaranteed in those cases should a reviewer recognize their work.\n\nAuthors may NOT submit the same work to both the regular and visa-friendly deadlines. While an author may appear on works in both submission deadlines, they must have substantially distinct content. Submissions to the main deadline deemed to duplicate early submissions will be rejected without review.\n\nACL Rolling Review (ARR)\nAuthors who have work submitted to ARR on or after August 15, 2024 may also submit an extended abstract to the WiNLP workshop. Because our conference accepts two-page abstracts as our primary form of submission, we ask that authors still submit an extended abstract through our Openreview page to ensure every poster has a corresponding two-page abstract. By default, abstracts are listed with their authors on the website, but our accepted abstracts are not archived in the ACL Anthology. Authors may elect to have their abstract linked from the conference website as a camera-ready. If your work is accepted while it should be under anonymity for reviewing purposes, please let us know when we solicit your camera-ready paper if you need your submission to be either unlisted or listed with anonymous authors.\n\nPeer Workshopping and Reviewing Procedure\nTen days prior to the submission deadline, authors will have the option to peer-review each others’ abstracts in a non-anonymous format, in groups of two or three authors. To participate in this process, authors must sign up using this form no less than two weeks before the deadline to which they choose to submit: either June for early review or August for regular review. Authors taking this option commit to help their peers edit and format their submissions, or revise for clarity, or provide general feedback before the submission is reviewed. Authors may use the feedback provided during this peer-editing period to update their submissions in time for the submission deadline. The program committee may still provide reviews, feedback, and direct writing mentorship for applicants, but the intent of peer-editing is to share this responsibility with the participants so that it can scale with the size of the workshop.\n\nWhether or not authors take advantage of this peer-review option in advance of submission, all submissions are due on the deadline (anywhere on earth). After the submission deadline, abstracts will be reviewed in the traditional double-blind format. Abstracts will be evaluated on relevance to the community; the presentation format (talk or poster) will be decided based on scientific merit and potential interest to a broad audience.\n\nTravel Support\nThere will be a limited amount of travel grants and/or additional funding to cover expenses, similar to the previous editions. Financial support will be made available for travel, lodging, registration, and visa costs for one author for each submission, subject to our available funding. The funded author may elect to attend virtually if they prefer. The selected author should be identified as part of the travel grant submission form. If we find ourselves with extra funds, we will attempt to support further funding for virtual attendance for additional authors, but we do not guarantee we can support any further in-person attendance. We recommend additional student authors keep an eye out for the EMNLP call for student volunteers or call for D&amp;I subsidies as opportunities for further funding.\n\nDifferent institutions have different funding availability, so we ask authors to please explore their funding options locally in addition to through WiNLP so we can extend our funds to as many participants as possible. More information will be made available closer to the submission deadline and linked from our workshop website at https://www.winlp.org/winlp-2024-workshop/ . Travel expenses are handled via reimbursement (primarily through $USD check or PayPal). If you will be unable to front the cost of travel expenses and your school or employer is unable to assist, please reach out to the organizers as soon as possible.\n\nContact information\nWebsite: https://www.winlp.org/winlp-2024-workshop/\n\nTwitter: @winlpworkshop\n\nFacebook: Widening NLP\n\nLinkedIn: Widening NLP\n\nE-mail: winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com\n",

    "title": "WiNLP Guidelines for Zoom Moderation",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "These guidelines are intended to help protect all WiNLP attendees and speakers in our Zoom events.\n\nGuidelines for WiNLP attendees:\n\n\n  \n    Do not share the Zoom link with anyone else. All WiNLP attendees will have access to our Zoom link via our registration email, or via the hosting conference workshop/session page. No one who is not either a WiNLP registree nor a hosting conference attendee should attend. Making the link public, in any way, opens you up to Zoom-bombing and other malicious activity by outside trolls.\n  \n  \n    Please ensure your Zoom name matches your registration. This helps chairs or volunteers easily catch non-registered attendees.\n  \n  \n    Ask us for help if you need it. Should you encounter disruptive behavior by an attendee, there are several steps you can take. Please keep in mind the following:\n    \n      For panels, a WiNLP chair or volunteer will be present in the Zoom session. You may post a note in the Zoom chat requesting assistance. (If you feel uncomfortable with the chat message being seen by all participants, you may use the private message function.)  You can also call a WiNLP volunteer or chair by putting a note requesting assistance with a link to your Zoom room in the WiNLP Slack channel #incidents. If the host conference has a RocketChat, you can likewise call a conference volunteer by putting a note in the RocketChat #incidents channel. (Precise channel name per hosting conference to be determined and communicated prior to each event.) The volunteers, on arrival, will have co-host permissions in the Zoom room.\n      If you are not comfortable taking these actions yourself, you can call on a WiNLP chair or conference volunteer to assist.\n      These are only for cases of disruptive behavior, and are not to be used, for example, merely in case of scientific disagreement.\n      Any author or volunteer who finds it necessary to deploy one of these ‘silencing’ options should report that fact to the WiNLP chairs, immediately upon the conclusion of the session, via Slack or email (winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com). You can and should also report the incident to the hosting conference’s PCC co-chairs, but if you do not feel comfortable doing so directly, the WiNLP chairs will help funnel that reporting.\n    \n  \n\n\nGuidelines for WiNLP chairs &amp; volunteers:\n\n\n  A chair or volunteer must be assigned to monitor the WiNLP Slack #incidents channel throughout the session, for potential incident reports.\n  A chair or volunteer must be assigned to be in the WiNLP Zoom session to monitor directly for potential harassment incidents.\n\n\nSteps for Active Moderation, for attendees &amp; volunteers:\n\nWe encourage you to take the minimal action that manages the disruption.Possible actions to handle a disruptive participant:\n\n\n  Mute the participant. This can be done via the Participants pane. At this point, it is also a good idea to uncheck the option that allows participants to unmute themselves.\n  Move the participant to the waiting room. If a participant continues to be disruptive despite being muted (e.g. via the chat), you can move them to the waiting room. This can be done even if the waiting room isn’t ‘enabled’, but it may be valuable to enable it at this point, in case the person tries to leave and reenter. Anyone with host or co-host privileges can send messages to the waiting room, but it is not possible to communicate with people in the waiting room via individual chat.\n  Remove the participant. This prevents the participant from easily coming back into the room.\n\n",

Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nCustomising\n\nWhen using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.\n\nTo add your own styles copy the styles.scss into your own project with the same file path (assets/styles.scss). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the @import \"alembic\"; line.\n\nIf you’re looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the _settings.scss file in your own styles.scss, make sure to state them before the @import \"alembic\"; line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from Sassline - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.\n",
