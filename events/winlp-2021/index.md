Please fill out** [**this form**](https://forms.office.com/r/kQcWYzpg8r) **by October 14 if you are from an underrepresented group in NLP will need financial support to register for EMNLP.**

### In an effort to make the workshop more welcoming to members of any underrepresented group, the WiNLP acronym stands for Widening NLP.

### The 2021 iteration of the workshop will, in particular, seek to highlight women and LGBTQ+ researchers and bring diversity in scientific background, discipline, training, obtained degrees, and seniority.

### The full-day event includes invited talks, a panel discussion, a tutorial, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work.

### WiNLP also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs. Most importantly, the workshop will provide an inclusive and accepting space, and work to lower structural barriers that make it difficult for underrepresented groups to join and collaborate with their NLP colleagues.

### The invited speakers and the panel members will be announced shortly.
