## Keynote A (Time: 9:15-10:15)

**Title**: Scaling Multilingual Evaluation of LLMs to Many Languages

**Speaker**: <a href="https://dadelani.github.io/">David Adelani</a>

**Abstract**: Despite the widespread adoption of Large language models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities remain limited to a few high-resource languages. In this talk, I would describe different approaches to scaling evaluation to several languages. First, I would describe simple strategies for extending multilingual evaluations by re-purposing existing English datasets to over 200 languages for both text (SIB-200) and speech modalities (Fleurs-SLU). Second, I would introduce our recent bench IrokoBench -- a human-translated benchmark dataset for 17 typologically-diverse low-resource African languages covering three tasks: natural language inference, mathematical reasoning, and multi-choice knowledge-based question answering. This evaluation expands the evaluation of many low-resource languages from simple text classification tasks to more challenging knowledge and reasoning tasks. We observe a significant performance gap between open and proprietary models, with the highest performing open model, Gemma 2 27B, only at 60\% of the best-performing proprietary model GPT-4o performance. These findings suggest that more efforts are needed to develop and adapt LLMs for low-resource languages. Finally, I will highlight some of our recent projects that make some of these challenging datasets more multicultural for Visual question answering and intent detection tasks, to encourage practical usage of LLMs within the low-resource communities.

**Bio**: Dr. David Adelani is an Assistant Professor at the McGill University School of Computer Science, a Core Academic Member at Mila - Quebec AI Institute, an IVADO Professor, and a Canada CIFAR AI Chair. He received his Ph.D in Computer Science at the Department of Language Science and Technology, Saarland University, Germany. His research interests include multilingual natural language processing with a focus on low-resource languages, speech processing, privacy and safety of large language models. With over 20 publications in leading NLP and Speech Processing venues like ACL, TACL, EMNLP, NAACL, COLING, and Interspeech, he has made significant contributions to NLP for low-resource languages. Notably, one of his publications received the Best Paper Award (Global Challenges) at COLING 2022 for developing AfroXLMR, a multilingual pre-trained language model for African languages. Other notable awards include an Area Chair Award at IJCNLP-AACL 2023, Outstanding Paper Award and Best Theme Paper Award at NAACL 2025.

## Keynote B (Time: 16:00-17:00)

**Title**: Language Models Do Not Have Human-Like Working Memory

**Speaker**: <a href="https://penguinnnnn.github.io/">Jen-Tse Huang</a>

**Abstract**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities, we demonstrate that they lack a fundamental aspect of human cognition: working memory. Human working memory is an active cognitive system that enables not only the temporary storage of information but also its processing and utilization, enabling coherent reasoning and decision-making. Without working memory, individuals may produce unrealistic responses, exhibit self-contradictions, and struggle with tasks that require mental reasoning. Existing evaluations using N-back or context-dependent tasks fall short as they allow LLMs to exploit external context rather than retaining the reasoning process in the latent space. We introduce three novel tasks: (1) Number Guessing, (2) Yes-No Deduction, and (3) Math Magic, designed to isolate internal representation from external context. Across seventeen frontier models spanning four major model families, we consistently observe irrational or contradictory behaviors, indicating LLMs' inability to retain and manipulate latent information. Our work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating working memory in LLMs and highlights this limitation as a key bottleneck for advancing reliable reasoning systems.

**Bio**: Jen-Tse (Jay) Huang is a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University, working with Mark Dredze. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and his B.Sc. from Peking University. His research explores the evaluation of large language models (LLMs), both as individual agents and as collectives in multi-agent systems, through the lens of social science. His work has been published in top-tier AI venues, including an oral presentation at ICLR 2024. He actively serves as a reviewer for major conferences and journals such as ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR and serves as an area chair in ARR.
