## Workshop Description

The **Widening NLP (WiNLP)** workshop aims to foster an inclusive environment that highlights the contributions of researchers from underrepresented groups in NLP. Anyone who self-identifies as being from an underrepresented background—based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, disability, or otherwise—is encouraged to submit. In 2025, WiNLP will continue placing emphasis on access, disability, and diversity across scientific backgrounds, disciplines, training, and underrepresented languages.

Our annual **Widening Natural Language Processing Workshop (WiNLP)** will be held in conjunction with **EMNLP 2025** in **Suzhou, China**. Since EMNLP is anticipating a hybrid format for their conference, we also anticipate our workshop will be hybrid, with both online and in-person attendees. The one-day workshop will occur during EMNLP’s workshop period with an exact date to be announced soon.

The full-day event includes invited talks, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice. It also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs. Most importantly, the workshop will provide an inclusive and accepting space, and work to lower structural barriers to joining and collaborating with the NLP community at large.

## Submission Guidelines

While everyone is encouraged to attend, the opportunity to present a talk or poster is intended for members of underrepresented groups at all career levels: students, post-docs, professors, and other researchers.

### Categories of Submissions

1. **Thesis Proposals**: Designed for graduate students (Master’s or PhD) to present their research plans and receive constructive feedback.
2. **Research Papers**: Encompasses both work-in-progress with preliminary results and completed research.

### Submission Length Options

Both categories can be submitted as:

- **Short Papers**: Up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendices. An additional content page is permitted upon acceptance (maximum 5 pages).
- **Extended Abstracts**: Up to 2 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendices. An additional content page is permitted upon acceptance (maximum 3 pages).

### Archival vs. Non-Archival Papers

Authors of short papers may choose whether their submission is archival or non-archival:

- **Archival Papers**: Will be published in the *EMNLP 2025 WiNLP Proceedings*.
- **Non-Archival Papers**: Can be submitted to other venues in the future, except for another WiNLP workshop.

> Note: Paper submissions must be fully self-contained. Supplementary materials, as provided in the appendix, are completely optional, and reviewers are not asked to review them. No separate supplementary files will be accepted.

- Neurosymbolic approaches to NLP
- Phonology, morphology, and word segmentation
- Question answering
- Resources and evaluation

## Multiple Submission Policy

For archival papers, **WiNLP enforces a strict no multiple submission policy**. Such papers submitted to WiNLP must not be under review at another journal, conference, or workshop during the WiNLP submission and review period. This prohibition includes submissions to ACL Rolling Review (ARR) 2025 May and EMNLP 2025. WiNLP submissions should not overlap significantly in content or results with papers that are already published or will be published elsewhere.

## Pre-Submission Mentorship Program

WiNLP offers an **optional pre-submission mentorship program** to help authors improve the quality of their writing and presentation before final submission. The program focuses on enhancing clarity and structure, not critiquing the research content.

### How It Works

- **Submission**: Authors must submit a draft via the designated [Google Form](https://forms.gle/J33K2ea6VruN82ke9) by **June 20, 2025**. Drafts must follow the same formatting and length guidelines as final submissions.
- **Mentor Assignment**: Organizers will check compliance before assigning a mentor. Mentors will not review the final submission.
- **Feedback**: Provided by **July 18, 2025**, offering suggestions to improve writing and presentation. Authors are encouraged to incorporate this feedback before the final deadline.
- **Non-Anonymous**: The mentorship process is not anonymized.
- **Final Submission**: Authors who participate should submit their final paper as a new submission via OpenReview by **August 1st, 2025**. Participation is not required for submission eligibility.

## Travel Support

WiNLP offers a limited number of travel grants to support **one author per accepted submission**. Grants may cover registration, travel, lodging, or visa costs. Funded authors may choose to attend virtually if preferred.

### Key Dates

| Event | Date |
| --- | --- |
| Travel grant application deadline | September 26, 2025 |
| Notification | October 6, 2025 |

### Eligibility

- One author per accepted submission is eligible.
- The funded author must be identified in the travel grant application form.

Additional funding for virtual attendance by other authors may be considered if surplus funds are available, but **in-person attendance for additional authors is not guaranteed**.

Travel expenses are handled via reimbursement (primarily through USD check or PayPal). Authors unable to front travel costs should contact the organizers early to discuss alternatives.

> **Note**: Authors are encouraged to explore local funding options (e.g., institutional support) to maximize the reach of WiNLP’s limited funds. We recommend student authors also look into the EMNLP call for student volunteers or call for D&I subsidies for further funding opportunities.
