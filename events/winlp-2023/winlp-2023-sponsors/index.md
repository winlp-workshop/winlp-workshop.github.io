We are currently reaching out to sponsors to request funding and will list our sponsors here as they are confirmed. For more information on how this list develops, please view our [Sponsor Policy](http://www.winlp.org/sponsor-policy/ "Sponsor Policy").

_Widening NLP does not endorse the sponsors of our workshop as employers, nor do we endorse the views they express or the products/services they offer. We are grateful for their sponsorship of our programs and we encourage our participants to do their own research into these organizations._
