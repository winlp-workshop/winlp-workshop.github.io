**Monojit Choudhury**

Dr. Monojit Choudhury is currently a Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft Turing, and previously was a Principal researcher at Microsoft Research Lab India. His research interests span various aspects of natural language processing and cognitive sciences, including multilingual models, ethics of NLP, and AI and NLP for social good. Dr. Choudhury is a Prof of Practice at Plaksha University and an adjunct faculty at IIIT Hyderabad. He is the general chair of the Panini Linguistics Olympiad, which is the Indian national linguistics Olympiad for high school students and is actively involved with the International as well as Asia Pacific linguistics Olympiads. Dr. Choudhury has a PhD and BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kharagpur.

## Panel: Tackling Misinformation in Generative AI

**Seraphina Goldfarb Tarrant**

Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant is the Head of Safety at Cohere, where she works on both the practice and the theory of evaluating and mitigating harms from LLMs. She did her PhD under Adam Lopez in Fairness in Transfer Learning for NLP, at the Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation (ILCC) in the Informatics department at the University of Edinburgh. She did her MSc in NLP, with a focus on Natural Language Generation, at the University of Washington under Fei Xia in collaboration with Nanyun Peng. Her research interests include the intersection of fairness with robustness and generalisation, cross-lingual transfer, and causal analysis. She had an industry career before her PhD, where she worked at Google in Tokyo, NYC, and Shanghai. She also spent two years as a sailor in the North Sea.

**Preethi Lahoti**

Preethi Lahoti is a Research Scientist at Google Research in its Responsible AI and Human Centered Technologies Organization, based in Zurich, Switzerland. Prior to this, she did her PhD in Computer Science (Machine Learning) at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Germany, where she was very advised by Prof. Gerhard Weikum and Prof. Krishna P. Gummadi. Her research focuses on enabling Responsible AI by developing new models and methods that detect, prevent and alleviate undesirable behaviors of ML by accounting for normative goals including fairness, robustness, trust and safety.

Jasmijn Bastings

Dr Jasmijn Bastings is a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind. They hold a PhD and MSc in artificial intelligence (AI) from the University of Amsterdam, and a BSc in AI with a minor in linguistics from Utrecht University. Jasmijn has worked on various topics within natural language processing, including automatic translation (e.g., Linguistically-informed NMT, Joey NMT) and interpretability (e.g., rationalizations, the Language Interpretability Tool), and has more recently been focusing on how to make language technology, in particular machine translation, more inclusive and gender fair.
