## Speakers

### Keynote A

**Danish Pruthi** 

Danish Pruthi is an Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. He received his Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

He is also a recipient of the Schmidt Sciences AI2050 Early Career Fellowship, Siebel Scholarship, the CMU Presidential Fellowship and industry awards from Google and Adobe Inc. Until recently, his legal name was only Danish—an “edge case” for many deployed NLP systems, leading to airport quagmires and, in equal parts, funny anecdotes.

### Keynote B

She is a part of the teams that developed the open LLM from AI2, model alignment, large scale pretraining data, and other evaluation benchmarks. She completed her Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University on grounded multimodal long-form generation from the Language Technologies Institute advised by Alan W. Black, Eric Nyberg and Yonatan Bisk. She is selected as a Rising Star by UC Berkeley EECS in 2020, led the team that won the sixth edition of the BioAsq Challenge and was awarded the Best All-Rounder Student in her undergraduation. She is active in the NLP community, serving as an Area Chair at NeuRIPS, COLM, ACL ARR. She actively also organized several workshops on generation at *CL conferences.

**Dirk Hovy**

Dirk Hovy is a Professor in the Computing Sciences Department of Bocconi University, and the scientific director of the Data and Marketing Insights research unit. He holds a PhD in NLP from USC’s Information Sciences Institute, and a master’s degree in linguistics from Marburg University in Germany. Dirk is interested in what computers can tell us about language, and what language can tell us about society. He is also interested in ethical questions of bias and algorithmic fairness in machine learning. He has authored over 150 articles on these topics, including 3 best and one outstanding paper awards, and published two textbooks on NLP in Python for social scientists. Dirk has co-founded and organized several workshops (on computational social science, and ethics and cultural aspects in NLP), and was a local organizer for the EMNLP 2017 conference. He was awarded an ERC Starting Grant project 2020 for research on demographic bias in NLP. Outside of work, Dirk enjoys cooking, leather-crafting, and picking up heavy things just to put them back down.

**Monojit Choudhury**

Monojit Choudhury is a professor of Natural Language Processing at Mohommed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), Abu Dhabi. Prior to this, he was a principal scientist at Microsoft Research Lab and Microsoft Turing, India. He is also a professor of practice at Plaksha University, and an adjunct professor at IIIT Hyderabad. Prof Choudhury’s research interests lie in the intersection of NLP, Social and Cultural aspects of Technology use, and Ethics. In particular, he has been working on multilinx gual and multicultural aspects of large language models (LLMs), their use in low resource languages and making LLMs more inclusive and safer by addressing bias and fairness aspects. Prof Choudhury is the general chair of Indian national linguistics Olympiad and the founding co-chair of Asia-Pacific linguistics Olympiad. He holds a BTech and PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kharagpur.

**Malihe Alikhani**

Malihe Alikhani is an assistant professor of AI and social justice at the Khoury School of Computer Science at Northeastern University and a member of the Northeastern Ethics Institute. She is also a Cultural Competence in Computing (3C) fellow. Her work focuses on studying and addressing biases in learning models, particularly in applications related to education, health, and social justice. This goal has led her to collaborate with educators, healthcare experts, and community leaders to create inclusive, technology-enabled experiences. Alikhani’s research aims to design inclusive and equitable language technologies that effectively communicate across diverse populations, with a special focus on underserved communities. By integrating insights from cognitive science, neuroscience, philosophy, policy, and social sciences with machine learning techniques, she develops computational models that capture the rich diversity of human interpretation and enhance the communicative power of language.
