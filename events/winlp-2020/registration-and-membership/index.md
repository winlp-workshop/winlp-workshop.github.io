## Registration

The ACL 2020 registration fees are drastically reduced, reflecting the move to being 100% virtual. The Early registration deadline is **June 26th (Friday)**. The fees charged will allow full access to all parts of the conference including the WiNLP workshop. Please make sure to register before the early registration deadline and follow instructions through ACL at **[ACL's Registration Page](https://acl2020.org/registration/)**. 

**Note:** If you would require financial assistance to attend **[WiNLP](https://twitter.com/WiNLPWorkshop/)**, please fill-up the WiNLP2020 **[Virtual Attendance Grant Application form](https://winlp.ling.washington.edu/survey/index.php/215716?lang=en)**. The registration subsidy is for the **[ACL](https://acl2020.org/)** main conference which would cover WiNLP Workshop as well.
