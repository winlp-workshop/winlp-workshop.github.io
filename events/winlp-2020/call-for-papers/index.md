## Workshop description

**The** **WiNLP** **workshop is open to all** to foster an inclusive and welcoming ACL environment.  It aims to promote diversity and highlight the work of underrepresented groups in NLP: anyone who self-identifies within an underrepresented demographic \[gender, ethnicity, nationality, etc\]. The 2020 iteration of the workshop will, in particular, seek to highlight diversity in scientific background, discipline, training, obtained degrees, seniority, and communities from underrepresented languages. The full-day event includes invited talks, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice.  It also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs. Most importantly,  the workshop will provide an inclusive and accepting space, and work to lower structural barriers to joining and collaborating with the NLP community at large.

While everyone is encouraged to attend, the opportunity to present a talk or poster is intended for members of underrepresented groups at all career levels: students, post-docs, professors, and other researchers. We invite submissions in the form of an extended 2-page abstract on topics in computational linguistics and natural language processing, including but not limited to:

- Cognitive modeling and psycholinguistics
- Computational social science
- Corpus development and evaluation
- Dialog and interactive systems
- Discourse and pragmatics
- Document analysis including text categorization, topic models, and retrieval
- Ethics in NLP
- Natural language generation
- Information extraction, text mining, and question answering
- Language-inclusive multimodal integration
- Linguistic theories for NLP
- Low-resource or endangered languages
- Machine learning
- Machine translation
- Mathematical models of language
- Multilinguality
- Phonology, morphology, and word segmentation
- Resources and evaluation
- Semantics
- Sentiment analysis and opinion mining
- Social media: Twitter, blogs, discussion forums, and other social media
- Sociolinguistics
- Speech, prosody, and spoken dialog
- Summarization
- Tagging, chunking, syntax, and parsing
- Vision, robots, and other grounding applications

## Submission guidelines

Submissions must be **anonymized** and follow the standard one-column format. Each submission should be a two-page extended abstract PDF, with any number of additional pages allowed for references (WiNLP/COLING proceedings format). No appendices will be accepted.

Submissions should follow the same style and format guidelines ([LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-and-instructions-for-winlp-2020/wmghdyddktfd) style files, [Word](http://www.winlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/WiNLP20_Template.docx) template) and be submitted electronically in PDF format via the WiNLP 2020 online submission system: [https://ww](https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/WiNLP/)[w.softconf.com/acl2020/WiNLP/](https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/WiNLP/)

## Peer Workshopping and Reviewing Procedure

1. **One week prior to the submission deadline**, authors will have the option to **peer-review** each others’ abstracts in a **non-anonymous** format, in groups of two or three authors. Authors taking this option commit to help their peers edit and format their submissions, or revise for clarity, or provide general feedback before the submission is reviewed. Authors may use the feedback provided during this peer-editing period to update their submissions in time for the submission deadline. As in WiNLP 2019, the program committee may still provide reviews, feedback, and direct writing mentorship for applicants, but the intent of peer-editing is to share this responsibility with the participants so that it can scale with the size of the workshop. Whether or not authors take advantage of this peer-review option in advance of submission, **all submissions are due on the deadline**.
2. After the submission deadline, abstracts will be reviewed in the traditional **double-blind** format. Abstracts will be evaluated on relevance to the community; the presentation format (talk or poster) will be decided based on scientific merit and potential interest to a broad audience.
3. To sign up and take advantage of peer workshopping, please visit the following sign-up link: [https://winlp.ling.washington.edu/survey/index.php/293366?lang=en](https://winlp.ling.washington.edu/survey/index.php/293366?lang=en)

## Multiple-Submission Policy

As we aim for improved and increased representation of underrepresented minorities, we will consider anonymized two pages abstracts of papers that have been submitted to other venues or have already been published elsewhere since January 1, 2019. However, authors must clearly indicate this at submission time.

Authors may not submit to both the regular and visa-friendly deadlines.
