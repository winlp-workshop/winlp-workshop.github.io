### The fourth WiNLP Workshop will be held in conjunction with ACL 2020 and will be **100% Online**. All times are in Pacific Time (GMT-7).

### In an effort to make the workshop more welcoming to members of any underrepresented group, the WiNLP acronym stands for Widening NLP.

### The 2020 iteration of the workshop will, in particular, seek to highlight diversity in scientific background, discipline, training, obtained degrees, and seniority.

### The full-day event includes invited talks, panel discussion, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice.

### It also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs. Most importantly, the workshop will provide an inclusive and accepting space, and work to lower structural barriers that make it difficult for URGs to join and collaborate with their NLP colleagues.

### Invited speakers include **[Verena Rieser](https://sites.google.com/site/verenateresarieser/), [Helena Caseli](https://sites.google.com/site/lalicufscar/pessoas/helena-caseli?fbclid=IwAR2KWVws1PtQ76JO3OgCf4-Ml_WcpHhHWlbB5M8-aDZYGP2vwolXGLP-P3Q), [José Eduardo Ochoa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-eduardo-ochoa-luna-6451b78/)**, and **[Rachael Tatman](http://www.rctatman.com/)**.
