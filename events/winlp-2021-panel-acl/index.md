**5:35 AM UTC:  Panel on NLP in the time of Corona: Stories from Asia**

The pandemic has hit women and gender-diverse people in every industry especially hard, resulting in significant drops in presence in the workplace and challenging those remaining in the workforce in unprecedented ways, as societies grapple with the mental, social, emotional, and logistic ramifications of living through a pandemic. The NLP research community, in academia and industry, is no exception to this. At the same time, changes in how we handle remote life — both for conferences and day-to-day research and teaching — along with adaptations that we have made individually, can impact our field for the better. In this panel, we talk with women and gender-diverse NLP researchers from throughout Asia about what challenges they have faced, how they have adapted, and what lessons we can take moving forward to create a more inclusive and accessible research community around the world.

**7:00 AM UTC:  Collaborative Tutorial**

**The Productivity Toolbox:** This 45-minute workshop will be an opportunity to talk about the tools and strategies we use as researchers to plan and sustain our projects. We'll talk specifically about how we organize things like managing a codebase, organizing references and literature review, and getting experiments up and running when you don't have a lot of computing resources. While we'll offer a few ideas, we're also interested in gathering your feedback, with the goal to gather this information into a page on the ACL Wiki for future use!

The WiNLP Workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior and senior members of the community to connect with each other, and discuss diversity efforts and issues.
