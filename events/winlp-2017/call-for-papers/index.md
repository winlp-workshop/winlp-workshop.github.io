The first WiNLP Workshop will be held in conjunction with ACL 2017 in Vancouver, Canada. WiNLP stands for **Women and Underrepresented Minorities in NLP**.

**Workshop Date:** July 30, 2017 (Tutorial day)

**Paper Submission Deadline:**  April 21, 2017  April 28, 2017

**The WiNLP workshop is open to all.**  Its aim is to highlight the work of women and other underrepresented genders and minorities in NLP -- anyone who self-identifies within an underrepresented demographic, and would benefit from a more inclusive ACL environment. The full-day event includes invited talks, oral presentations, and poster sessions, and provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice.  It also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs.  Most importantly, the workshop serves to share and promote the work of subpopulations in NLP that face additional barriers to entry and acceptance in the NLP community.

While everyone is encouraged to attend, the opportunity to present a talk or poster is intended for underrepresented genders and minorities (students, post-docs, professors, and other researchers). We invite submissions in the form of an extended 2-page abstract on topics in computational linguistics and natural language processing, including but not limited to:

- Cognitive modeling and psycholinguistics
- Corpus development and evaluation
- Dialog and interactive systems
- Discourse and pragmatics
- Document analysis including text categorization, topic models, and retrieval
- Natural language generation
- Information extraction, text mining, and question answering
- Language-inclusive multimodal integration
- Linguistic theories for NLP
- Low-resource or endangered languages
- Machine learning
- Machine translation
- Mathematical models of language
- Multilinguality
- Phonology, morphology, and word segmentation
- Resources and evaluation
- Semantics
- Sentiment analysis and opinion mining
- Social media: Twitter, blogs, discussion forums, and other social media
- Sociolinguistics
- Speech, prosody, and spoken dialog
- Summarization
- Tagging, chunking, syntax, and parsing
- Vision, robots, and other grounding applications

### Submission Guidelines

**Papers:**

Submissions must follow the standard two-column format of the ACL 2017 proceedings.  Each submission should be a two-page Extended Abstract pdf, with any number of additional pages allowed for references.

- Authors should use the ACL 2017 style files:  [Latex](http://acl2017.org/downloads/acl17-latex.zip) or [Word](http://acl2017.org/downloads/acl17-word.zip).
- [We have also made the Latex available on Overleaf, including an example Extended Abstract](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zdnchjnsfmmm).

The deadline for submission is 11:59pm GMT -12 on April 21, 2017. Submission will be electronic using the paper submission web page at [https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/winlp](https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/winlp).

**Reviewing Procedure:**

Submissions will be peer reviewed in the double-blind format. Abstracts will be evaluated on relevance to the community; the presentation format (talk or poster) will be decided based on scientific merit and potential interest to a broad audience.

**Multiple-Submission Policy:**

As our goal is to highlight contribution to the community from women and underrepresented minorities, we will consider anonymized 2-page abstracts of papers that were submitted to other venues or published elsewhere in the past year (i.e. after Jan 1st, 2016), though authors must indicate this at submission time.
