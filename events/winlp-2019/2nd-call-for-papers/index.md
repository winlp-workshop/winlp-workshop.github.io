## Widening NLP Workshop 2019

 

This early call-for-papers targets **authors who may require extra time to apply for a visa.**

**Visa-friendly submission deadline: Friday, February 1, 2019.**

**Visa-friendly notification deadline: Thursday, March 1, 2019.**

Submission link: \[ [https://www.softconf.com/acl2019/WiNLP2019/](https://www.softconf.com/acl2019/WiNLP2019/) \]

In 2018 some authors were unable to present at NLP conferences because they could not obtain a visa in time. WiNLP 2019 is adding a visa-friendly submission deadline, to allow authors of accepted papers 4-5 months to obtain an Italian visa if their passport is not automatically entitled to one. If your passport allows you to receive an Italian visa automatically in less than 2 months, please use the regular submission deadlines.

 

The regular workshop deadlines will follow the suggested ACL submission/notification dates:

**Submission deadline:** Apr 26, 2019. **May 5, 2019.**

**Notification deadline:** May 24, 2019. **May 28, 2019.**

 

Workshop date: Sunday, July 28, 2019

## Workshop description

The third WiNLP (“Widening NLP”) Workshop will be held in conjunction with ACL 2019 in Florence, Italy.

**The** WiNLP **workshop is open to all** to foster an inclusive and welcoming ACL environment.  It aims to highlight the work of underrepresented groups in NLP: anyone who self-identifies within an underrepresented demographic \[gender, ethnicity, nationality, etc\]. The 2019 iteration of the workshop will, in particular, seek to highlight diversity in scientific background, discipline, training, obtained degrees and seniority. The full-day event includes invited talks, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for junior members in the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice.  It also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial labs. Most importantly,  the workshop will provide an inclusive and accepting space, and work to lower structural barriers to joining and collaborating with the NLP community at large.

While everyone is encouraged to attend, the opportunity to present a talk or poster is intended for members of underrepresented groups at all career levels: students, post-docs, professors, and other researchers. We invite submissions in the form of an extended 2-page abstract on topics in computational linguistics and natural language processing, including but not limited to:

- Cognitive modelling and psycholinguistics
- Computational social science
- Corpus development and evaluation
- Dialog and interactive systems
- Discourse and pragmatics
- Document analysis including text categorization, topic models, and retrieval
- Natural language generation
- Information extraction, text mining, and question answering
- Language-inclusive multimodal integration
- Linguistic theories for NLP
- Low-resource or endangered languages
- Machine learning
- Machine translation
- Mathematical models of language
- Multilinguality
- Phonology, morphology, and word segmentation
- Resources and evaluation
- Semantics
- Sentiment analysis and opinion mining
- Social media: Twitter, blogs, discussion forums, and other social media
- Sociolinguistics
- Speech, prosody, and spoken dialog
- Summarization
- Tagging, chunking, syntax, and parsing
- Vision, robots, and other grounding applications

 

## Submission guidelines

Submissions must follow the standard one-column format. Each submission should be a two-page extended abstract PDF, with any number of additional pages allowed for references (WiNLP/COLING proceedings format). No appendices will be accepted.

Papers should follow the same style and format guidelines (LaTeX, Word) and be submitted electronically in PDF format via the WiNLP 2019 online submission system \[[https://www.softconf.com/acl2019/WiNLP2019/](https://www.softconf.com/acl2019/WiNLP2019/) \].

- We have made the [Latex Template and Instructions for WiNLP 2019 available on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-winlp-2019/mhxmjzrcrzrr), and a [Word Template](http://www.winlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/WiNLP19_Template.docx), including an example of an Extended Abstract.

 

## Editing and Reviewing Procedure

1. Within the first week after the submission deadline, submitted abstracts will be **peer-edited** in **non-anonymous** format, in groups of three or four authors. Authors commit to helping their peers edit and format their submissions, or revise for clarity, or provide general feedback before the submission is reviewed. Authors may update their submissions during this period to incorporate this feedback, but may not significantly alter the scientific content. As in WiNLP 2018, the program committee will still provide reviews, feedback, and direct writing mentorship for applicants, but the intent of peer-editing is to share this responsibility with the participants so that it can scale with the size of the workshop.
    
    #### The procedure in more detail:
    
    > 1.1. corresponding authors submit anonymous pdf. 1.2. each corresponding author receives 3 of the pdf from step 1 and an e-mail address for each pdf. Thus each corresponding author now knows who wrote each of those 3 submissions. similarly, each author receives writing feedback from 3 other authors, so they know who wrote their 3 pieces of peer feedback. 1.3. corresponding authors update their anonymous pdf and re-upload. 1.4. reviewers -- none of whom were involved in step 2 -- receive anonymized pdf and do a double-blind review.
    
2. One week after submission and peer-editing, abstracts will be reviewed in the traditional **double-blind** format. Abstracts will be evaluated on relevance to the community; the presentation format (talk or poster) will be decided based on scientific merit and potential interest to a broad audience.

 

## Multiple-Submission Policy

As we aim for improved and increased representation of underrepresented minorities, we will consider anonymized two pages abstracts of papers that have been submitted to other venues or have already been published elsewhere since January 1, 2018. However, authors must clearly indicate this at submission time. Authors may not submit to both the regular and visa-friendly deadlines.

 

## Travel support

There will be a limited amount of travel grants and/or additional funding to cover expenses, similar to the 2017 and 2018 workshops. More information will be made available closer to the submission deadline and linked from [http://www.winlp.org/winlp-2019-workshop/](http://www.winlp.org/winlp-2019-workshop/)
