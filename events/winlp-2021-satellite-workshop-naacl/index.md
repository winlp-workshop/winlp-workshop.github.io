### Our two-hour panel “NLP in the Time of Corona: Adaptations and Lessons for Women and Allies” will be held in conjunction with NAACL and will be **free and online**, organized by Widening NLP.

The panel will take place on **Wednesday, June 9th from 1-3 PM GMT. The event is open to all.**

**Register here: [Eventbrite Page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/naacl-winlp-panel-nlp-women-in-the-time-of-corona-registration-154296146929)**

In preparation for joining this event, please review our **Zoom Code of Conduct, located here:** [WiNLP Guidelines for Zoom Moderation](http://www.winlp.org/winlp-guidelines-for-zoom-moderation/)

The pandemic has hit women and gender-diverse people in every industry especially hard, resulting in significant drops in presence in the workplace and challenging those remaining in the workforce in unprecedented ways, as societies grapple with the mental, social, emotional, and logistic ramifications of living through a pandemic. The NLP research community, in academia and industry, is no exception to this. At the same time, changes in how we handle remote life -- both for conferences and day-to-day research and teaching -- along with adaptations that we have made individually, can impact our field for the better. In this panel, we talk with women and gender-diverse NLP researchers at various stages of career growth about what challenges they have faced, how they have adapted, and what lessons we can take moving forward to create a more inclusive and accessible research community around the world.

#### Panel

We are excited to host a panel of NLP experts from industry and academia to discuss their experiences as women and gender-diverse researchers during the pandemic, and reflect on ways to capture inclusive adaptations to the field moving forward. Our panel will be moderated by Dr. Surangika Ranathunga of University of Moratuwa, one of our WiNLP workshop organizers.

Libby Barak is a postdoctoral associate in the department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Rutgers University - Newark. She completed her M.Sc. at Bar-Ilan University working on text classification and earned her Ph.D. from the University of Toronto while working on models of verb acquisition. Dr. Barak then spent two years as a post-doc in the Psychology department at Princeton University working with Adele Goldberg exploring models of language learning. Dr. Barak's research interests are in the areas of cognitive modeling of language and learning. Dr. Barak's goal is to create computational models that simulate plausible representations of the learner and the input by accounting for theoretical findings from experimental observations on human behavior. By using this modeling approach, Dr. Barak aims to clarify how learning and linguistic factors interact to facilitate the rapid pace of natural language learning and how learning may vary given individual differences among learners.
