#### **Writing Tutorial**

As part of the WiNLP satellite event at EACL 2021, we are organizing a beginners' tutorial on writing for academic conferences, with a specific focus on how to write a good extended abstract. Slides can be found [here](http://www.winlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/winlp-writing-tutorial.pdf).

Note: If you would like to have a complimentary [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) code for writing assistance, please use this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAANAAfe8TVJUNTNBSzlFQzNIWFlPRDhSVlcwVVJSQ1RRTy4u).

Participants for this tutorial should be first time authors (or close to), submitting to conferences and workshops or other academic venues like fellowships in or adjacent to the field of NLP and Computational Linguistics (\*ACL community).

The tutorial will consist of a presentation on the lifecycle of a paper, from writing to publication, and detailed advice on good academic writing, followed by an interactive peer-review-like activity for which participants are invited (but not required) to bring their own extended abstracts or writing drafts they would like feedback from other participants on.

##### **Format**

The first part of the tutorial will cover the “life of a paper,” demystifying conference calls for papers, formatting guidelines and templates, rules like the ACL’s anonymity period, and a number of small things that are often left unsaid: What is an area chair? Is author order important? What is a camera-ready? How do I use a rebuttal? Closing out this half will be a short group-based Q&A.

The second part will zoom in on the writing itself: how do I write a good extended abstract? We will establish and motivate some guidelines for academic writing, from knowing your audience to anticipating common flaws in academic papers. Emphasis will be placed on extended abstracts and how to actually cram all the things you want to say into so small a space (and how not to!), and we will finish up by listing some specific tools like useful LaTeX packages, gotchas like pixel images, and a list of resources for further reading.

The third and final part of the tutorial will give participants a chance to judge extended abstracts “in the wild” in a peer-review-like group activity to reaffirm and use the theoretical advice from the previous part constructively. For this, we will provide some sample extended abstracts, but we also invite participants to bring a draft extended abstract/fellowship app draft if they want it to be used for this exercise.
