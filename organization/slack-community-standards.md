title: WiNLP Slack Community Standards
---

*Last updated April 26, 2021*

The following standards apply to everyone who is a member of the WiNLP Slack Community. Anyone who violates these standards may be sanctioned or expelled from this Slack community at the discretion of the WiNLP Chairs.

This is a “living” document, and will be changed as WiNLP Chairs see fit. We will notify the group whenever changes are made.

1. **Be respectful:** Treat all community members with respect. Express your opinions kindly and respectfully.
2. **Be polite:** Be mindful of excessive posting or spamming. Know that all-caps may be read as YELLING! And yelling at someone is usually not very nice.
3. **Report concerns:** Please don’t “name and shame” other members of the community publicly. We are here to help; if you have an argument or unpleasant encounter with someone, please contact an individual WiNLP chair or email [winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:winlp-chairs@googlegroups.com). If the person who is harassing you is a volunteer or organizer, or they have a conflict of interest, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. All reports will be handled promptly and in the strictest confidence. We also believe that people can address and change their behaviors through self-work. The organizers can discuss a person’s development and make decisions on a case-by-case basis.
4. **Maintain privacy:** Do not share your account information with anyone. We will never ask for your password. Do not post personal information (phone numbers, email addresses, passwords, account information, physical addresses, first and last names, etc) about yourself or others.
5. **Do not harass anyone.** This includes: 
    - Sexual solicitation, 
    - Threatening, stalking, or intimidating others, 
    - Zoombombing, 
    - Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion,
    - Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm,
    - Ongoing inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others,
    - Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease,
    - Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect other community members or other vulnerable people from intentional abuse,
    - Publication of non-harassing private communication without consent by the involved parties,
    - Repeatedly ignoring questions, content, or comments from people based on the personal characteristics of the person that is making them (such as ignoring women in the group),

WiNLP reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding “reverse”-isms, such as “reverse racism” or “cisphobia.”
