# WiNLP 2025 Workshop
## Workshop Description
The Widening NLP (WiNLP) workshop aims to foster an inclusive environment that highlights the contributions of researchers from underrepresented groups in NLP. Anyone who self-identifies as being from an underrepresented background—based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, disability, or otherwise—is encouraged to submit. In 2025, WiNLP will continue placing emphasis on access, disability, and diversity across scientific backgrounds, disciplines, training, and underrepresented languages.
